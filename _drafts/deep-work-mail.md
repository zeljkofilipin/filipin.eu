title: 'Deep Work: Read Mail After Lunch'
---
I was in a habit of making a big deep work mistake. I would start my day with checking my mail and messages. Some days that would not take a lot of time. I still think that's a mistake because I was spending the morning, when I'm the freshest and could do the best work, on a shallow work task like reading mail.

But that's not the only problem. Some days I would spend all day reacting to things. Mostly in mail, but sometimes in chat. The more you reply to mail and chat, the more replies you get and the cycle never ends.

Now I try to check mail and chat in the afternoon, usually after lunch. That leaves me a few hours of deep work in the morning, when I'm the freshest.
