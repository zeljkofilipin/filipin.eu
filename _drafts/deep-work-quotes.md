## Introduction

> **Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.** (5544)

> Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity.

> The term “deep work” is my own

> The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools. This is a broad category that captures communication services like e-mail and SMS, social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, and the shiny tangle of infotainment sites like BuzzFeed and Reddit. In aggregate, the rise of these tools, combined with ubiquitous access to them through smartphones and networked office computers, has fragmented most knowledge workers’ attention into slivers.

> This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking.

> Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

> In an age of network tools, in other words, knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shallow alternative—constantly sending and receiving e-mail messages

> We can, I hope, stipulate that network tools negatively impact deep work.

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

> This book has two goals, pursued in two parts. The first, tackled in Part 1, is to convince you that the deep work hypothesis is true. The second, tackled in Part 2, is to teach you how to take advantage of this reality by training your brain and transforming your work habits to place deep work at the core of your professional life.

> **I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.** (5700)

> A deep life is a good life.

## Part 1: The Idea

### Chapter 1: Deep Work Is Valuable

#### Deep Work Is Valuable Introduction

> **In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital.** (9014)

##### The High-Skilled Workers

##### The Superstars

##### The Owners

#### How to Become a Winner in the New Economy

> **Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy**
>
> - **The ability to quickly master hard things.**
> - **The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.** (7347)

> If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.

> **If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.** (8800)

> The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work.

#### Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things

> To learn requires intense concentration.

> This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.

> **To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction.** (8501)

> To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work.

#### Deep Work Helps You Produce at an Elite Level

> High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

> when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.

> To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

#### What About Jack Dorsey?

> Deep work is not the only skill valuable in our economy, and it’s possible to do well without fostering this ability, but the niches where this is advisable are increasingly rare.

### Chapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare

#### Deep Work Is Rare Introduction

> Facebook, of course, is not the only Silicon Valley heavyweight to embrace the open office concept.

> Another big business trend in recent years is the rise of instant messaging.

> A third trend is the push for content producers of all types to maintain a social media presence.

> I mention these three business trends because they highlight a paradox.

> Many other ideas are being prioritized as more important than deep work in the business world, including, as we just encountered, serendipitous collaboration, rapid communication, and an active presence on social media.

> To summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level).

#### The Metric Black Hole

> He discovered that Atlantic Media was spending well over a million dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails,

> Even though we abstractly accept that distraction has costs and depth has value, these impacts, as Tom Cochran discovered, are difficult to measure.

> Generally speaking, as knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts.

#### The Principle of Least Resistance

> The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

> To return to our question about why cultures of connectivity persist, the answer, according to our principle, is because it’s easier.

> To name another example, consider the common practice of setting up regularly occurring meetings for projects. These meetings tend to pile up and fracture schedules to the point where sustained focus during the day becomes impossible. Why do they persist? They’re easier.

> Also consider the frustratingly common practice of forwarding an e-mail to one or more colleagues, labeled with a short open-ended interrogative, such as: “Thoughts?”

> A little more care in crafting the message by the sender could reduce the overall time spent by all parties by a significant fraction.

#### Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity

> Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value.

> Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: ... doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

#### The Cult of the Internet

> Postman argued that our society was sliding into a troubling relationship with technology. We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.

> We no longer see Internet tools as products released by for-profit companies, funded by investors hoping to make a return, and run by twentysomethings who are often making things up as they go along. We’re instead quick to idolize these digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new world.

> Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. Even worse, to support deep work often requires the rejection of much of what is new and high-tech.

#### Bad for Business. Good for You.

> Deep work should be a priority in today’s business climate. But it’s not.

> depth will become increasingly rare and therefore increasingly valuable. Having just established that there’s nothing fundamentally flawed about deep work and nothing fundamentally necessary about the distracting behaviors that displace it, you can therefore continue with confidence with the ultimate goal of this book: to systematically develop your personal ability to go deep—and by doing so, reap great rewards.

### Chapter 3: Deep Work Is Meaningful

#### Deep Work Is Meaningful Introduction

> It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another:

> deep life is not just economically lucrative, but also a life well lived.

#### A Neurological Argument for Depth

> skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

> The world represented by your inbox, in other words, isn’t a pleasant world to inhabit.

#### A Psychological Argument for Depth

> “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.” Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow

> Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock.

> Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

> When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they suspected.

> **Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.** (7272)

> the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding.

> “jobs should be redesigned so that they resemble as closely as possible flow activities.”

> **To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.** (7288)

#### A Philosophical Argument for Depth

> ... to embrace deep work in your own career [...] is an effort that can transform a knowledge work job from a distracted, draining obligation into something satisfying ...

#### Homo Sapiens Deepensis

> A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.

## Part 2: The Rules

### Rule #1: Work Deeply

#### Work Deeply Introduction

> Unfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. To understand why this is true let’s take a closer look at one of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial.

> **You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.** (8563)

> **The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.** (8267)

#### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy

##### The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

> This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.

> the pool of individuals to whom the monastic philosophy applies is limited

##### The Bimodal Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

> This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales. For example, on the scale of a week, you might dedicate a four-day weekend to depth and the rest to open time. Similarly, on the scale of a year, you might dedicate one season to contain most of your deep stretches

> the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day.

##### The Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

> the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.

> it takes time to ease into a state of concentration

> the rhythmic philosophy is one of the most common among deep workers in standard office jobs.

##### The Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling

> I call this approach, in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule, the journalist philosophy.

> This approach is not for the deep work novice.

> I instead tend to map out when I’ll work deeply during each week at the beginning of the week, and then refine these decisions, as needed, at the beginning of each day

#### Ritualize

##### Where you’ll work and for how long.

> (a colleague of mine likes to put a hotel-style “do not disturb” sign on his office door when he’s tackling something difficult).

> Regardless of where you work, be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.

##### How you’ll work once you start to work.

> you might institute a ban on any Internet use

##### How you’ll support your work.

> For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee, or make sure you have access to enough food of the right type to maintain energy, or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear.

#### Make Grand Gestures

> By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task.

#### Don’t Work Alone

> This decision between promoting concentration and promoting serendipity seems to indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is incompatible with generating creative insights (a collaborative endeavor). This conclusion, however, is flawed.

> haphazard combination of different disciplines, thrown together in a large reconfigurable building, led to chance encounters and a spirit of inventiveness that generated breakthroughs at a fast pace

> This combination of soundproofed offices connected to large common areas yields a hub-and-spoke architecture of innovation in which both serendipitous encounter and isolated deep thinking are supported. It’s a setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.

> Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter.

> This back-and-forth represents a collaborative form of deep work (common in academic circles) that leverages what I call the whiteboard effect. For some types of problems, working with someone else at the proverbial shared whiteboard can push you deeper than if you were working alone.

> Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations.

> When it comes to deep work, in other words, consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level.

#### Execute Like a Business

##### Execute Like a Business Introduction

> The 4 Disciplines of Execution (...) 4DX

> The 4DX framework is based on the fundamental premise that execution is more difficult than strategizing.

##### Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important

> “The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.” ... execution should be aimed at a small number of “wildly important goals.”

> For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours.

##### Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures

> Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve.

> the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior:

> Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.”

> lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals. For an individual focused on deep work, it’s easy to identify the relevant lead measure: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.

##### Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

> “People play differently when they’re keeping score,”

> I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week

> To maximize the motivation generated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in an academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark corresponding to the hour where I finished the result.

##### Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

> recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead

> I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead.

#### Be Lazy

#### Be Lazy Introduction

> At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free

##### Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights

> some decisions are better left to your unconscious mind to untangle. In other words, to actively try to work through these decisions will lead to a worse outcome than loading up the relevant information and then moving on to something else while letting the subconscious layers of your mind mull things over.

> for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.

> providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges.

##### Reason #2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply

> spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.

> Walking in nature provides such a mental respite, but so, too, can any number of relaxing activities

> Having a casual conversation with a friend, listening to music while making dinner, playing a game with your kids, going for a run

> Only the confidence that you’re done with work until the next day can convince your brain to downshift to the level where it can begin to recharge for the next day to follow. Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown.

##### Reason #3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important

> for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more.

> capacity for deep work in a given day is limited.

#### Be Lazy Summary

> once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention.

> Another key commitment for succeeding with this strategy is to support your commitment to shutting down with a strict shutdown ritual that you use at the end of the workday to maximize the probability that you succeed. In more detail, this ritual should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.

> When you’re done, have a set phrase you say that indicates completion (to end my own ritual, I say, “Shutdown complete”).

> Shutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness

> experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks

> regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done.

#### Rule #2: Embrace Boredom

#### Embrace Boredom Introduction

> The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.

> Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.

> you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

> constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain.

> If every moment of potential boredom in your life—say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. Rule #1 taught you how to integrate deep work into your schedule and support it with routines and rituals designed to help you consistently reach the current limit of your concentration ability. Rule #2 will help you significantly improve this limit.

> improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.

> To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli.

#### Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.

> Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times.

##### Point #1: This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies.

##### Point #2: Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.

##### Point #3: Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.

> To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.

#### Work Like Teddy Roosevelt

> identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time.

> there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity

> Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable.

#### Meditate Productively

> The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem.

> goal should be to participate in at least two or three such sessions in a typical week.

##### Suggestion #1: Be Wary of Distractions and Looping

##### Suggestion #2: Structure Your Deep Thinking

#### Memorize a Deck of Cards

> A side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate.

> there’s nothing special about card memorization. Any structured thought process that requires unwavering attention can have a similar effect

#### Rule #3: Quit Social Media

#### Quit Social Media Introduction

> we increasingly recognize that these tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.

> To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.

> these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be quite vital to your success and happiness, but at the same time also accepting that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time and attention (not to mention personal data) should be much more stringent, and that most people should therefore be using many fewer such tools.

> The Any-Benefit Approach to Network Tool Selection: You’re justified in using a network tool if you can identify any possible benefit to its use, or anything you might possibly miss out on if you don’t use it.

> The use of network tools can be harmful.

> Throughout history, skilled laborers have applied sophistication and skepticism to their encounters with new tools and their decisions about whether to adopt them. There’s no reason why knowledge workers cannot do the same

> The notion that identifying some benefit is sufficient to invest money, time, and attention in a tool is near laughable to people in his trade.

> The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

##### Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

> “Twitter is crack for media addicts.”

> The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life.

> Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal.

> ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact

> Keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts. To help illustrate this strategy

> Personal Goal: To maintain close and rewarding friendships with a group of people who are important to me. Key Activities Supporting This Goal: Regularly take the time for meaningful connection with those who are most important to me (e.g., a long talk, a meal, joint activity). Give of myself to those who are most important to me (e.g., making nontrivial sacrifices that improve their lives).

> this strategy, if applied as described, will lead many people who currently use tools like Facebook or Twitter to abandon them—but not everyone.

> The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

##### Quit Social Media

> In more detail, this strategy asks that you perform the equivalent of a packing party on the social media services that you currently use. Instead of “packing,” however, you’ll instead ban yourself from using them for thirty days. All of them: Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Twitter, Snapchat, Vine

> Don’t formally deactivate these services, and (this is important) don’t mention online that you’ll be signing off

> After thirty days of this self-imposed network isolation, ask yourself the following two questions about each of the services you temporarily quit: Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? Did people care that I wasn’t using this service? If your answer is “no” to both questions, quit the service permanently. If your answer was a clear “yes,” then return to using the service.

> For most people this reality will confirm something that seems obvious only once you’ve done the hard work of freeing yourself from the marketing messages surrounding these tools: They’re not really all that important in your life.

##### Don’t Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

> Bennett writes in his 1910 self-help classic, How to Live on 24 Hours a Day.

> Put more thought into your leisure time.

> if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative.

#### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

#### Drain the Shallows Introduction

> Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities.

> for someone new to such practice ... an hour a day is a reasonable limit. For those familiar with the rigors of such activities, the limit expands to something like four hours, but rarely more.

> once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more.

> To summarize, I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated.

##### Schedule Every Minute of Your Day

> On some days, you might rewrite your schedule half a dozen times. Don’t despair if this happens. Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs; it’s instead to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you’re doing with your time going forward—even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

> The second tactic that helps is the use of overflow conditional blocks. If you’re not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it.

> It’s a simple habit that forces you to continually take a moment throughout your day and ask: “What makes sense for me to do with the time that remains?”

> Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday.

##### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

> How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

> Once you know where your activities fall on the deep-to-shallow scale, bias your time toward the former.

##### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

> What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work?

> the answer to the question will be somewhere in the 30 to 50 percent

##### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty

> I call this commitment fixed-schedule productivity, as I fix the firm goal of not working past a certain time, then work backward to find productivity strategies that allow me to satisfy this declaration.

> Fixed-schedule productivity, in other words, is a meta-habit that’s simple to adopt but broad in its impact. If you have to choose just one behavior that reorients your focus toward the deep, this one should be high on your list of possibilities.

##### Become Hard to Reach

###### Tip #1: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work

> I call this approach a sender filter, as I’m asking my correspondents to filter themselves before attempting to contact me.

###### Tip #2: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails

> What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?

> process-centric approach to e-mail, and it’s designed to minimize both the number of e-mails you receive and the amount of mental clutter they generate.

###### Tip #3: Don’t Respond

> it’s the sender’s responsibility to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile.

> Professorial E-mail Sorting: Do not reply to an e-mail message if any of the following applies: It’s ambiguous or otherwise makes it hard for you to generate a reasonable response. It’s not a question or proposal that interests you. Nothing really good would happen if you did respond and nothing really bad would happen if you didn’t.

## Conclusion

> A commitment to deep work is not a moral stance and it’s not a philosophical statement—it is instead a pragmatic recognition that the ability to concentrate is a skill that gets valuable things done.

> Deep work is way more powerful than most people understand.

> The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits.
