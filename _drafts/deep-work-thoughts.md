This book is one of three books that I've mentioned in the [Books That Have Changed My Life](/books-that-have-changed-my-life) post. It's one of the rare books that I've read more than once. It is the only book (as far as I can remember) that I've read twice in just a few months.

My manager has recommended this book a while back. My to-read list is pretty big so it was there for a while. Recently, I've listened to the audio book. I was really impressed with the book. So impressed that I've bought the e-book, to read it again.

I've found that approach to work very well for me. I listen to a lot of audio books. That allows me to read a lot. But, listening to audio books is not deep work. I'm usually doing something else, like driving, cleaning or running. Rarely, I'll read a book that's so good that I want to immediately read it again. Deep work is one of those rare books.

The second time I've read it as an e-book on my old Kindle. I like reading on Kindle because of it's e-ink screen, it's small size and lack of distractions. It does allow me to highlight sections and sync it to the cloud, so it's easy later to review highlights on a computer and copy/paste to a blog post, if needed.

Sometimes, while listening to an audio book, I'll have an idea, but since I don't have an easy way to write it down, I usually forget it.

For a long time I was not happy with my productivity. I tend to start many projects, but did not finish them as quickly as I wanted. I think deep work and the second essential tool in my daily work. The other one being GTD. I don't think any one of them solves all of my project planning problems, but together, they work magic.

For example, I can't really focus on a task for hours or days if I know there are other urgent things to do. Or even if I'm not sure if there are other urgent or important things to do. To be really productive, I have to spend some time reviewing my current projects, making sure I'm not missing any deadlines, or that there isn't anything more important to do at the moment. With my mind free of thinking about that, I can focus all of my attention at one task.

If you've ever worked hard all day but you felt you didn't do almost anything, except answer a lot of mail, this book is for you.

One mistake I used to do a lot of to check my mail in the morning. That usually ended with me spending the majority of the day, if not the whole day in my inbox. These days I'll make sure to work on a project or two in the morning, and check my mail only after lunch, or even later in the day, when I feel that I don't have energy left for deep work. I can usually triage mail with very little brain power.

Even if you manage to triage your mail in the morning and you have the afternoon for working on projects, I'm usually more tired and less productive in the afternoon. It really makes little sense to spend the best hours of your day (morning) on mail. You should work on a hard problem then, and check mail in the afternoon.

One of the problem of email is that it produces more email. If you respond to all of your messages in an hour or two, by the time you're done, you'll receive answers to some of the messages and the never ending circle of email continues.

Another problem are meetings. I've tried to get out of as many meetings as I could. For a while I had a fear of missing out, because sometimes I would learn valuable information at meetings. Also, I didn't want to look like I'm avoiding work. I had a chat with my manager (he recommended Deep Work in the first place) and he agreed that I should leave the meetings I didn't think are providing value. I've also marked Tuesdays and Fridays as "busy" in my work calendar, so people know not to schedule meetings with me.

One way of dealing with fear of missing out from not attending meetings (especially department and company-wide) is to let my manager know about that and to ask him to let me know if there's something important that I've missed. Missing out on weekly project or team meetings - I think my colleagues are good enough to reach out to me if they think I need to know something, or smart enough to reach out to me if they need my help. It's still early days for that experiment, but I didn't notice missing out anything yet.

One way I fight distractions (especially while doing deep work) is to have a paper notepad. Here and there, while working on something and actively avoiding distractions, I'll have an idea. I need to do this, or I would like to look this up. If it's not important, I'll ignore it. If it's important, I'll write it down in the notepad, so I don't forget. That helps me to go back to deep work, sure that the other thing will get done later. It frees my mind from the thing, because I've captured it in the notepad and I don't have to keep it in my mind. I avoid writing it on the phone, because that might lead to other distractions. In the rare moments that I don't have the notepad but I have the phone, I'll write it down on the phone. It's more important to clear my mind than not to use the phone.

Try turning off notifications for apps. Apps really really don't like it. TODO: screenshots.

I used to have have a few tabs always open in my browser. Now I close all but the ones I'm currently using.

### Chapter 2: Deep Work Is Rare

#### Introduction

Joel Spolsky of was way ahead of it's time when he introduced private offices in the Joel test.

#### The Principle of Least Resistance

Writing email messages (and instant messages), phabricator tasks and similar in a way that the other person can quickly and easily respond might be harder to you short-term, but much better long-term.

#### Rule #4: Drain the Shallows

##### Finish Your Work by Five Thirty

I'm really bad at this. I tend to start my work day late, and I tend to finish late. But, I don't work crazy hours.
