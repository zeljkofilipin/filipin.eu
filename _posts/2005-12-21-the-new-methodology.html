<p>Roy Osherove <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2005/12/19/433503.aspx">preporučuje</a> nedavno osvježeni esej <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html">The New Methodology</a>. Napisao ga je Martin Fowler. Pridružujem se preporuci.</p>
<p>Prenosim samo sažetak eseja:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the past few years there's been a blossoming of a new style of software methodology - referred to as agile methods. Alternatively characterized as an antidote to bureaucracy or a license to hack they've stirred up interest all over the software landscape. In this essay I explore the reasons for agile methods, focusing not so much on their weight but on their adaptive nature and their people-first orientation.</p></blockquote>
