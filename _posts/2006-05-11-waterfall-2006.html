<p>I was reading Jonathan Kohl's blog. He wrote about <a href="http://www.kohl.ca/blog/archives/000164.html">Hiding Behind Languages, Frameworks and Processes</a>. There was link to <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/">Waterfall 2006</a>. He said it was a joke.</p>
<p>Joke!?</p>
<p>I remember I have read about Waterfall 2006 at <a href="http://testingreflections.com/">testingReflections.com</a>. I do not remember that it was a joke. I just remember that somebody said he would go there (looks like it was Roland Stens in <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/node/view/3378">Waterfall2006: I'll be there!</a>). I remember I have read that blog and thought: "Waterfall. Conference. 2006. Strange." However, I did not get the joke.</p>
<p>I went to waterfall2006.com. Conference date was April 1, 2006. Slowly, slowly, I got it. Joke!</p>
<p>Then I read (some of) Waterfall 2006 articles. Go there. Read the articles. Smile. :)</p>
