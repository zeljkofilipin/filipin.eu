<p>From <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:QA_TestCase_Writing_Day#Tips_on_Writing_a_Good_TestCase">wiki.mozilla.org</a></p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Pretend you're writing a bug - it's pretty much the same</li>
<li>Assume that the person following your test case only has basic familiarity with the product. For example:
<ul>
<li><em>"Bring up the New Calendar Wizard"</em> - This is too vague.</li>
<li><em>"Launch the New Calendar Dialog (by either double clicking calendar list, File->New Calendar or right clicking calendar list)."</em> - This is much better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be fairly specific with the expected results
<ul>
<li><em>"It worked"</em>  - Once again, too vague.</li>
<li><em>"The event was created on the proper day; The event had the proper color"</em> - This is great.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep list of steps and expected results as simple as possible.</li>
<li>You don't need to detail every click unless it's an important part of the testcase.
<ul>
<li><em>Click on the name text box; enter a name. Click on Color drop down, pick red.</em>-- This is a little much</li>
<li><em>Give the calendar a name, assign it a color.</em> --This is much better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
