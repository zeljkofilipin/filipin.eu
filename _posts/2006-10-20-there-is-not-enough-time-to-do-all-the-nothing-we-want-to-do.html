<p>I noticed that I am writing mostly about tools that I use. Well, I guess it makes sense. I think that tools make you efficient. Not only tools for testing, but also good e-mail client, good feed reader...</p>
<p>Also, I am new to testing. I am tester just over two years. So, although I do have some experience, I do not have a lot of experience. I guess my posts can be of some help to people that are starting with testing. Others might find my thoughts funny, in the best case. Just give me <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">a year or six</a> and you will read some interesting stuff here.</p>
<p>I have started <a href="http://iskusivac.blog.hr/">blogging</a> about a year ago (in Croatian). Do not even go there. I will try to translate interesting posts and post them here. But, beeing the only tester that speaks Croatian did not help by blog. I lost interest in writing because I felt nobody was reading. I like to write, and I do think that I have something to say. But writing for myself was just not enough motivation.</p>
<p>Then I joined <a href="http://www.testingreflections.com/blog/3071">testingReflections</a> (in English). But I did not like the blogging software there. (I have already moved here almost all posts from testingReflections.)</p>
<p>Finally I found <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> blogging software, bought a domain, a friend of mine had some hosting he was currently not using, and here I am.</p>
<p>Today I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that <span class="entry-author-name">Brent </span>Strange <a href="http://qainsight.net/2006/10/20/Software+Is+Like+Sausage.aspx">pointed</a> to my blog. Thanks Bret. Blogging takes time, but I think it makes sense if it is "adding value". Although it never crossed my mind that Ruby and Watir are "the dark side". :)</p>
<p>Why this title? I want to write about lots of interesting things, but I do have to do some real work. By the way, <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/b/billwatter163166.html">Bill Watterson</a> said "There is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do."
