<p>I am reviewer for Brian Marick's book Scripting for Testers. I wondered if it got cancelled, because the last post at reviewers mailing list was in July. Today I have red at Brian's blog that</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog/2006/11/29#everyday">Scripting for Testers has been renamed Everyday Scripting in Ruby</a></p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadly, the scheduled ship date is a bit after Christmas. Since it would be sad if testers didn't get the book under their tree, we've decided to delay the holiday.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how is he going to do that?</p>
