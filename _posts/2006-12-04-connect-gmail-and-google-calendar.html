<p>I just love Gmail.</p>
<p>I am just trying Google Calendar, and it looks good.</p>
<p>What I would like to see is Gmail and Google Calendar connected. There are contacts in Gmail. I would like that there is option to add birthday/anniversary field to contact and option to automatically include birthday/anniversary of that contact to my calendar (like Outlook has).</p>
<p>I listen to Gmail Podcast. In <a href="http://www.chuckchat.com/gmail/?p=45">Suggest Features</a> episode I found out that I can suggest that feature to Gmail team. If you think that is good idea, go to <a href="https://services.google.com/inquiry/gmail_suggest/">https://services.google.com/inquiry/gmail_suggest/</a> and write something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Connect Gmail and Google Calendar - add birthday/anniversary field to contact and add option to automatically include birthday/anniversary of that contact to my calendar.</p></blockquote>
