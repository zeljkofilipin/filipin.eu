title: FireWatir (WATiR on Firefox) Alpha v1.0 Works!
---
<p>I found the reason why FireWatir was <a href="/firewatir-watir-on-firefox-alpha-v10-released/">not working</a> at my machine.</p>
<p>Installation guide for FireWatir in step 2.e. says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Close Firefox. Restart it again using command “[Firefox installation directory]/firefox.exe –jssh” from command prompt.</p></blockquote>
<p>I opened Command Prompt at Firefox installation directory and copy/pasted "firefox.exe –jssh" (of course, without quotes) there. Pressed enter.</p>
<p>The next step (2.f.) is:</p>
<blockquote><p>To check if JSSh is listening on port 9997 run command “telnet localhost 9997” from command prompt.</p></blockquote>
<p>I copy/pasted "telnet localhost 9997" (also without quotes) to command prompt, pressed enter and got error message.</p>
<p>It took some time and a pretty long conversation at wtr-general mailing list to find the solution to my problem. At the end, I found it myself.</p>
<p>It seems that Word Replaces hypen (shorter -) with dash (longer –).</p>
<p>You can find that setting here:</p>
<p>Word (2003, service pack 2) > Tools > AutoCorrect Options... > AutoFormat > Replace > Hypens (--) with dash (–).</p>
<p>When I replaced dash (longer –) with hypen (shorter -) in "firefox.exe –jssh", everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>What have I learned? Never write documentation in Word. Do it in Notepad.</p>
<p>The whole conversation is <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/wtr-general%40rubyforge.org/msg02974.html">here</a>.</p>
