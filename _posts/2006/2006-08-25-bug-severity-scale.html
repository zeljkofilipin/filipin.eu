title: Bug Severity Scale
---
<p>From time to time I have to forward our bug severity scale to a customer responsible for reporting bugs.</p>
<p>We use only the first five. I do not remember when I reported a bug with severity six or seven.</p>
<p>1. Showstopper - blocks development and/or testing work, production could not run<br />
2. Critical - crashes, loss of data, major memory leaks<br />
3. Major - major loss of function<br />
4. Minor - minor loss of function; other problem where easy workaround exists<br />
5. Trivial - cosmetic issue like typo, misaligned images, and similar<br />
6. Fix if time - super-low priority<br />
7. Don't Fix</p>
