title: Don’t Use Bug Counts to Measure Testers
---
<p>I have just read a short article, <a href="http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/bugcount.pdf">Don’t Use Bug Counts to Measure Testers</a> by <a href="http://www.kaner.com/">Cem Kaner</a>.</p>
<p>The last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you really need a simple number to use to rank your testers, use a random number generator. It is fairer than bug counting, it probably creates less political infighting, and it might be more accurate.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.testing.com/cgi-bin/blog">Brian Marick</a> mentioned it at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agile-testing/">agile-testing@yahoogroups.com</a>.</p>
