<p>Are you in search for good feed reader? I am. I just need something that will work with all feeds I find (not so trivial), that will import my feeds from another reader (who likes to add feeds by hand?) and that looks like e-mail client (do you also find that feeds are like e-mail?).</p>
<p>Also, I prefer web applications. After all, I am a tester, I do strange things to my computer, so I like my data to be somewhere else. For example, all my e-mail is at <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/">Gmail</a>.</p>
<p>For a while, I used <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a>. It worked pretty well (thought it had problems with some feeds), but it is desktop application.</p>
<p>Then I switched to <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>. It has only one problem. When you click at feed that has two or more unread items, it marks all posts as read. I just do not want that.</p>
<p>I have tried <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Mail Beta</a>. Looks good, but it is not usable yet. I like the idea of e-mail and feed reader at one place.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> is updated. Old reader was really unusable. The new one looks good. I will try it for a few days and decide should I switch to it.</p>
