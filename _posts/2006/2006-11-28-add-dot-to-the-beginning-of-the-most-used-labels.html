title: Add Dot to the Beginning of the Most Used Labels
---
<p>I just love Gmail labels. I have lots of them, over two hundred. Every person has a label. I also have several special labels, like <em>personal </em>and <em>work</em>. I use them to label mail that I have read but can not respond at the moment. I use those special labels a lot. Labels are sorted alphabetically, so those labels are at the bottom (<em><strong>p</strong>ersonal</em>, <em><strong>w</strong>ork</em>). I use a simple trick to move them to the top of the list. I add dot to the beginning of label. Now <em>personal</em> is <em>.personal</em>, and <em>work</em> is <em>.work</em>. You could use another character, but I like dot. It is small and useful.</p>
