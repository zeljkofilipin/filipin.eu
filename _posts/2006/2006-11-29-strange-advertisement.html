<p>I was very surprised today when I saw this advertisement in Windows Live Messenger 8 this morning. This looks to me like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet">Arabic alphabet</a>, but since I can not read it, I really can not be sure. I wonder why Messenger thinks I can read Arabic? Maybe my Croatian preferences confused it?</p>
<p>In any case, this looks like a bug to me. Why?</p>
<p>Commercial is there because somebody wants me to buy something from them. Right? But it should be written in language that I understand, otherwise I would miss it. Even if commercial is written in language I can read, it should be written in alphabet I could read. Commercial written in any other alphabet, even in language I understand, would miss me.</p>
<p>Maybe this advertisement is intentionally strange to intrigue me. If that is the case, it succeeded. I clicked that commercial and it leads to <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/features">http://get.live.com/messenger/features</a>.</p>
