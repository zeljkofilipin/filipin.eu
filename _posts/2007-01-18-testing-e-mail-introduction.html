title: 'Testing E-mail: Introduction'
---
<p>Lately I have been testing e-mail functionality of one application. I will post my experience in two or three articles. This is the second one. Yesterday I blogged about <a href="/testing-e-mail-install-smtp-server/">how to install SMTP server</a>.</p>
<p>Testing is lots of fun. You do something, see what your application does and decide if it is correct behaviour.</p>
<p>Testing e-mail functionality of web applications is lots of fun, too. Also, it can be very time consuming.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you start a discussion at a forum. After discussion is started, forum members receive e-mail saying that new message is started. You could get the same e-mail, or just a confirmation e-mail saying that your contribution was successful. Some members maybe do not receive e-mails immediately after discussion is added, but receive a digest. Every 5, 10, 20 messages; daily, weekly, monthly digest. Some decided that they do not want any e-mail notification.</p>
<p>Another functionality of that forum could be that it receives e-mail. When member of forum sends an e-mail to forums e-mail address, discussion is started, it is visible at web interface, and members of forum receive e-mail notification, regarding of their preferences.</p>
<p>You can test all that. The boring part is waiting... and waiting... more waiting... and some more waiting. You get the point.</p>
<p>If you have Gmail account, you can use it for testing. If you have Gmail address username@gmail.com, just add +something between username and @gmail.com. Like this username+something@gmail.com. Anything you sent to that address will end up in your inbox. That way you can use one account for multiple users.</p>
<p>I would recommend that just for quick test. In my experience, sent e-mail will be delivered somewhere between a few seconds and a few hours. Rarely, even a few days. And the waiting part was really a problem to me.</p>
<p>There is a quicker way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending e-mail: <a href="/testing-e-mail-install-smtp-server/">install SMTP Server</a> at your machine.</li>
<li>Receiving e-mail (manual): set up application in a way that all mail is delivered to a folder at the same server were web application is, so you can quickly check it (no delays).</li>
<li>Receiving e-mail (automated): set up POP3 server that will get all mail from that folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not know how to do that set up, I was lucky enough to have a colleague who did it for me. :)</p>
<p>I will provide more details on automated testing of e-mail functionality in the next post.</p>
