<p>I started to get a lot of spam comments, and yesterday I installed <a href="http://akismet.com/">Askimet</a>. This morning, I found a bug in Askimet. Don't you just love to start a day with a bug? :)</p>
<p>This is bug report I sent.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I think I found a bug.</p>
<p>I have WordPress 2.1 and Akismet 2.0.</p>
<p>At "/wp-admin/edit-comments.php?page=akismet-admin" page (Comments > Akismet Spam) I have 51 spam comment, just enough for two pages.</p>
<p>There I can click "2" or "Next Page »" link that leads me to "wp-admin/edit-comments.php?page=akismet-admin&apage=2" page.</p>
<p>There are links "« Previous Page" and "1" that lead to "wp-admin/edit-comments.php?page=akismet-admin&apage=" page (please notice that the number "1" is missing at the end of the url).</p>
<p>At that page I get this error message:</p>
<p>"WordPress database error: [You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '-50, 0' at line 1]<br />
SELECT * FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = 'spam' ORDER BY comment_date DESC LIMIT -50, 0"</p>
<p>I guess that is because I am at page "[...]&apage=" and it should be "[...]&apage=1" (again, the number "1" is missing at the end of the url).</p>
<p>Links "2" or "Next Page »" point to "[...]&apage=2" and links "« Previous Page" and "1" point to "[...]&apage=" instead of "[...]&apage=1" (once more, just to be sure, the number "1" is missing at the end of the url).
</p></blockquote>
