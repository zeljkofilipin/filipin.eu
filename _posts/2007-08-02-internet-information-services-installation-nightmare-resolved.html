title: Internet Information Services Installation Nightmare (Resolved)
---
<p>I just do not understand what happened. I tried to install Internet Information Services (IIS) but it kept complaining that it needs Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 (SP2) CD. The first error message was "The file 'staxmem.dll' on Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 CD is needed."</p>

<p>I do not have that CD. I only have Windows XP Professional SP1 CD that I got with my machine. The funny thing is that I have installed IIS before at this machine and I do not remember that I had problems with that. I looked around and found out that the problem is that I have SP2 installed, but only SP1 CD.</p>
<p>I found the solution at <a href="http://webservertalk.com/message380029.html">webservertalk.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=049C9DBE-3B8E-4F30-8245-9E368D3CDB5A&displaylang=en">Download SP2</a> from Microsoft. Open Command Prompt and navigate to folder where SP2 is located and type </p>
<p><code>WindowsXP-KB835935-SP2-ENU.exe /?</code></p>
<p>Window with title Extracting Files will appear.</p>

<p>After it is done, temporary directory will be created in C:\ with funny name like 94340997294df09a342ed3029c. Also, window with title Service Pack 2 Setup will appear.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/sp2.thumbnail.png" alt="sp2.png" /></p>
<p>Temporary directory is deleted when you click OK, so leave it open until you are done with IIS installation.</p>
<p>Finally, you can start (or continue) with IIS installation. When Windows says that it can not find staxmem.dll point it to C:\[sp2 temp folder]\i386, and when it asks for adsutil.vbs point it to C:\[sp2 temp folder]\i386\ip.</p>
<p>You can use this trick with SP2 whenever Windows asks you for Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 CD. I successfully installed USB drivers in VMware virtual machine that way.</p>
