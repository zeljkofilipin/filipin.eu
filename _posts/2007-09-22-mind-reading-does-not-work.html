<p>I wrote this post months ago, but I did not publish it because I felt it was not finished. The time has come. I have read <a href="http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/jason_darling/default.aspx">Jason Darling's</a> post at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/watir-general">Watir General</a> titled Identifying problems and proposing solutions for the Watir community (I can not find that post at Watir General site at the moment). Great post. I would like to add a thought or two.</p>
<p>When posting to Watir General, please give enough of information so I could understand your problem. A snippet of HTML that you have problem with and a line or two of your Ruby code that tries to do something with that HTML will do. Just to make myself clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not give too much irrelevant information. The whole HTML of your page or your entire Ruby script is too much.</li>
<li>Do not give too little information. Please, do not make me ask this questions again and again:
<ul>
<li>What did you do?</li>
<li>What did you expect?</li>
<li>Why do you mean by not working?</li>
<li>Can you please post <strong>relevant</strong> snippet of your HTML and Ruby code?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Noticed <strong>relevant</strong>? I really do not have time to browse through entire HTML pages and Ruby scripts. Really.</p>
<p>I intended to make a page at <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Project+Home">Watir wiki</a> with such information, but never got the time. Well, now that the content is here, creating wiki page is just a minute of work.</p>
<p>I am just not sure that Jason's post, this post, or wiki page will make a difference. Well, I can try. I will even post this at Watir General.</p>
<p>By the way, the title for this post if from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/micahel/archive/2007/01/17/ThisIsYourBrainOnRst.aspx">This Is Your Brain On RST</a> article by Michael J. Hunter also known as The Braidy Tester.</p>
