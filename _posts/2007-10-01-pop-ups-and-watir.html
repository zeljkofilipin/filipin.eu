<p>Different pop ups that Internet Explorer pops from time to time are bugging Watir users a lot. <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/paul_rogers/index.html">Paul Rogers</a> wrote a document about it, and I promised I will publish it at <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Project+Home">Watir wiki</a> a long time ago.
