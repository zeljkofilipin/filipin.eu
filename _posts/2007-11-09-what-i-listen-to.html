<p>Google introduced new feature at Google Reader that I was waiting for. You can <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/11/attack-of-20ers.html">show list of your subscriptions</a>. So I removed default WordPress' blogroll and added one from Reader. Current version is the same as Worpress', with a fix or two (changed url's). You can see it at the bottom of <a href="/about-me/">About Me</a> page in What I read box. I will update it next week.</p>
<p>Today I was busy with updating What I Listen To box, that lists podcasts that I am subscribed to.</p>
