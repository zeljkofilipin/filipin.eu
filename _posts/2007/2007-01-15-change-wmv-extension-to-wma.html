title: Change wmv Extension to wma
---
<p>Did you know that if you have a file with wmv extension you can listen to it on your mp3 player? All you have to do is change it's extension to wma.</p>
<p>I have heard this on a podcast, but I do not have the link to it right now. I will try to find and post it soon.</p>
<p>You can go to <a href="http://testingeducation.org/k04/video/">http://testingeducation.org/k04/video/</a> and download a lot of good videos that will teach you how to test, and than listen to them at your mp3 player.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
