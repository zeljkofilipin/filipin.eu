title: 'Testing E-mail: Tools'
---
<p>Lately I have been testing e-mail functionality of one application. In the beginning I though that I would write two or three posts about that experience. Now I think there will be more, but not much more. I prefer more shorter articles that two or three longer ones. I am all about little steps, as you will shortly see.</p>
<p>This is the third article. Last week I wrote a little <a href="/testing-e-mail-introduction/">introduction</a> and <a href="/testing-e-mail-install-smtp-server/">how to install SMTP server</a>.</p>
<p>As I wrote the <a href="/test-if-application-sends-correct-e-mails/">last year</a>, when testing e-mail, I am using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and this Ruby libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>receive e-mail - <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/index.html">Net::POP3</a></li>
<li>send e-mail - <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/net/smtp/rdoc/index.html">Net::SMTP</a></li>
<li>create (before sending) and parse e-mail (after receiving) - <a href="http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/tmail/">TMail</a></li>
</ul>
