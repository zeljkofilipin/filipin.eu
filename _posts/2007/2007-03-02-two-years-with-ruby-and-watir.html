<p>According to <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Watir+Users">Watir Users</a> page at Watir wiki I have been using <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.openqa.org/watir/">Watir</a> for two years. I checked <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a> log, and the first entry is dated 11th March 2005. I checked out the code. There is 58 files in three folders. Tests are for two projects, and the biggest file has over 600 lines, so I guess I was writing scripts for month or two before I checked it into SVN.</p>
<p>By the way, the code is horrible. :) I have read somewhere that if you look at your old code and you do not think</p>
<blockquote><p>What was I thinking when I wrote this?!?!</p></blockquote>
<p>it means that you have not learned anything since then.</p>
<p>It has been interesting two years.</p>
