<p>I was reviewer for <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/bmsft/">Everyday Scripting with Ruby For Teams, Testers, and You by Brian Marick</a>. Over two months ago I received an e-mail from Pragmatic Programmers saying that if I send them my mailing address they would send me a free copy. I replied with my mailing address, but the book did not arrive.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago I sent them a reminder. No reply.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/wtr-general@rubyforge.org/msg06878.html">thread at wtr-general about the book</a> and I asked if anybody had a similar experience. I thought that maybe there is a problem because I am from Europe. I got one reply. George from UK received his book two months ago.</p>
<p>Today I got e-mail from Pragmatic Programmers. They are looking into the problem, and they have sent me a PDF copy in the meantime.</p>
<p>There is even text "Prepared exclusively for Zeljko Filipin" at the bottom of each page. I am sure that it is there not only to make feel exclusive, but they got me smiling whenever I notice it. :)</p>
<p>Chapters that I reviewed were great and I look forward to reading the book.</p>
