title: How much space does Windows CD take
---
<p>I inserted my Windows CD in CD drive, right-clicked it and selected Properties from context menu. It said: "Used space: 573 MB". Then I selected all files and folders at that drive, right-clicked and selected Properties. It said "Size: 815 MB". Strange. CD has maximum capacity of 700 MB, right?</p>
