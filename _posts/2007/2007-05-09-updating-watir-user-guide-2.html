title: Updating Watir User Guide (2)
---
<p><em>(From <a href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/wtr-general/2007-May/010754.html">wtr-general</a>.)</em></p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about updating <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/watir_user_guide.html">Watir user guide</a> these days, but I did not have time to start working. I will have some time next week (if not before). I think if user guide is migrated to <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Project+Home">Watir Wiki</a> it would make contributions much easier, so I plan to do that. If anybody would like to start working on user guide before I migrate it to Wiki, go ahead and grab it from <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/svn/watir">Watir SVN</a> repository, make Wiki page and start working. If you do not know <a href="http://www.openqa.org/watir/cvs.action">how to get it from SVN repository</a> or <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Contributing+to+this+Website">how to create Wiki page</a>, please let me know.</p>
<p>I received a lot of good advice about updating user guide. There is a clear need for more documentation on Watir. I do not think that everything should be in user guide. My plan is to make user guide as short as possible and provide links to more advanced topics. Something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Ruby.</li>
<li>Install Watir.</li>
<li>Open IE.</li>
<li>Navigate to a page.</li>
<li>Click a link.</li>
<li>Click a button.</li>
<li>Verify some text is there.</li>
<li>That was easy!</li>
<li>Want to learn more?</li>
<li>See how you can work with:
<ul>
<li>Other tags.</li>
<li>Various pop-up windows.</li>
<li>JavaScript.</li>
<li>AJAX.</li>
<li>Unit tests (running them, reading them, learning from them).</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is also lots of good documentation on Watir that <strong>is</strong> at our site. See:
<ul>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>What is Ruby?</li>
<li>What is Watir?</li>
<li>Is there a difference?</li>
<li>Why should I care?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is also lots of good documentation on Watir that <strong>is not</strong> at our site. Check it out:
<ul>
<li>Articles.</li>
<li>Cheat sheets.</li>
<li>Books.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have question? We have mailing list! When posting a question make sure that you include:
<ul>
<li>Relevant snippet of your Watir code.</li>
<li>Relevant snippet your HTML.</li>
<li>Error message that Ruby gave you (if any).</li>
<li>See example question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this short tips about posting to mailing list are very important. I just hope people will read it.</p>
<p>I think we are ready for several Watir tutorials (at least two).</p>
<p>Take Ruby for example. It has <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Pickaxe</a> book that you can have on your desk and not be embarrassed when you boss takes a look at it. There is also <a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/">Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</a>. I remember how my boss was surprised when he saw Why's book. I am sure he thought I was joking when I told him that it is a book about programming. (Hint: cartoon foxes shouting "Chunky bacon!".)</p>
<p>Watir user guide can have "enterprise look", but I would also like to create one version with cartoon characters. I am sure there are lots of creative people here and I hope they will show their creativity. If you would not like to see cartoon characters in Watir user guide, please do let me know, I will not put it at Watir Wiki. (I will put it at my blog and smile to my jokes. Alone.)</p>
