title: How to Get Text from Status Bar

<p>There was an interesting question recently at Watir General forum. How to get text from Internet Explorer status bar using Watir? I did not know that it was possible. Not only it is possible, but it is so easy.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
browser.status
=> "Done"
{% endhighlight %}
