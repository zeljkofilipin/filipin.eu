title: Watir 1.5.2 released
---
<p>I came back from a long vacation, and what a surprise. Watir 1.5.2 is out!</p>
<p>According to RubyForge, it was <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104">over two years since the last major update</a> (1.4.1). There were <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Development+Builds">a lot of minor updates</a> in the meantime, and you could always <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FAQ#FAQ-devgem">get the latest source</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/2007/09/05/Watir+1.5.2+Released">official release post</a> at Watir wiki.</p>
