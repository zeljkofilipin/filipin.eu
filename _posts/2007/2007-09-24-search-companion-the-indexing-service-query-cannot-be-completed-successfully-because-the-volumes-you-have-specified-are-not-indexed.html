title: 'Search Companion: The Indexing Service query cannot be completed successfully because the volumes you have specified are not indexed.'

<p>I usually search application logs using Windows Explorer and it works fine. But this time, I tried to search for string <em>@domain</em> and Search Companion pop up appeared with error message "The Indexing Service query cannot be completed successfully because the volumes you have specified are not indexed." I knew that there was nothing wrong with indexing because all other searches were working fine.</p>
<p>Google search found a page <a href="http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/fenske/annoy.htm">Unsolved Annoyances</a> that said you will get that error message if you search for strings that start with either of following characthers: !#@</p>
