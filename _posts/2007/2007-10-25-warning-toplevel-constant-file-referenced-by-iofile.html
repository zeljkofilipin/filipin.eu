<p>I want to delete a file from <code>Application::Mail.download</code>. The problem is that inside <code>Application</code> module, <code>File.delete</code> calls <code>Application::File.delete</code>.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
module Application
  class File
    def delete
    end
  end
  class Mail
    def self.download
      File.delete "mail.eml"
    end
  end
end

Application::Mail.download
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Run this code and you will get error message:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
Exception: undefined method `delete' for Application::File:Class
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I could rename <code>Application::File</code> to something else, but I created <code>Application</code> module because I wanted to name my classes as I wish without conflicts with Ruby classes.</p>
<p>One solution is to specify that I want to call <code>IO::File.delete</code>.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
def self.download
  IO::File.delete "mail.eml"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But then I get this warning:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
warning: toplevel constant File referenced by IO::File
{% endhighlight %}

<p><a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/127608">How to ignore warning</a> thread at <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/">ruby-forum.com</a> provided the solution to removing warning. Add this at the beginning of the file:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
$VERBOSE = nil
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But, I want to see other warnings. I know I can change the value of <code>$VERBOSE</code> to <code>nil</code> just before I call <code>IO::File.delete</code> and then change it back. That just feels wrong. Why am I getting that warning after all? Why do I get the warning after calling <code>IO::File.delete</code>? Am I doing something wrong?</p>
