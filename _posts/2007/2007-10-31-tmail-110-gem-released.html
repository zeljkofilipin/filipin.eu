<p>I have been using TMail for testing e-mail functionality of web application that I test <a href="/test-if-application-sends-correct-e-mails/">for a long time</a>. But, development of that library stopped at 2004. Today I found out that it is again in development. Take a look at it's <a href="http://tmail.rubyforge.org/">web site</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/tmail/">RubyForge project site</a>.</p>
