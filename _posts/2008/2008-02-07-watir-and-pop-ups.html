title: Watir and Pop Ups
---
<p>I am updating <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Tutorial">Watir Tutorial</a> for a while now. It is still not done. At the moment, I am at the <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Pop+Ups">Pop Ups</a> page. I have gathered data from <a href="http://www.kohl.ca/">Jonathan Kohl's</a> excellent user guide, <a href="http://www.paulrogers.ca/">Paul Rogers'</a> excellent pop ups article and <a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FAQ">Watir FAQ</a>. I will continue to do that, but I need help.</p>
<p>At the moment I have found solutions for 4 types of pop ups: new browser windows, file uploads, JavaScript pop ups and security alerts. 4 types are not covered yet: modal dialogs, modeless dialog, basic authentication and file downloads.</p>
<p>Since pop ups are source of problems for lots of Watir users, I would really appreciate any help. If you have working code, ideas or just a little time to review what I have done, please do it. Tutorial is just a bunch of wiki pages that anybody can edit and comment. If you need help with wiki, please let me know.</p>
