title: Would My Watir Tests Run With Firewatir?
---
<p>I saw this question at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/watir-general/">watir-general</a>.</p>
<p>Short story is, there is no simple solution at the moment. I am just porting my tests from Watir to Firewatir and I have noticed two major differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Firewatir does not see page text the same way as Watir does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watir would see "logged in as name".</li>
<li>Firewatir would see "logged in as\n\nname".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
  Firefox sees relative urls in links, while Internet Explorer sees apsolute paths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watir would see "page.htm".</li>
<li>Firewatir would see "domain.com/page.htm".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I created a separate branch of my tests for Firewatir, until I see what should be changed in original tests to make them compatible with both Watir and Firewatir. If I can not make them work at both, I do not think that maintaining two branches will be much work.</p>
<p>If you are using id's for identifying page elements, I think most of your test should work.</p>
