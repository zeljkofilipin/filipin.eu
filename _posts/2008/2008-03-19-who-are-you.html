<p>You know all <a href="/about-me/">about me</a>. I would like to know just a bit about you. The only tool I have is statistics. But, we all know that there are three kinds of lies: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics">lies, damned lies, and statistics.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> says I have 22 subscribers (on average). Slowly growing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> says that traffic is also slowly growing (Oct 1, 2006 - Mar 19, 2008).</p>

<p>65% of traffic comes from search engines. You are probably from US, Croatia, India, or UK. Top 5 content is <a href="/">front page</a>, <a href="/category/software/ruby/watir/">Watir category</a>, <a href="/ruby-deep-copy-object/">Ruby: (Deep) Copy Object</a> post (a surprise for me), <a href="/category/software/e-mail/">e-mail category</a> and <a href="/about-me/">about me page</a>.</p>
<p>What does it all mean? <a href="http://site.despair.com/blog/2007/10/11/new-despairwear-your-blog/">More people have read this shirt than my blog.</a></p>
<p>If it is not too much of me to ask, would you leave a comment with your name and link to your site, if you have one, please?</p>
