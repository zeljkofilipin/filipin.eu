The first Ruby on Beers meeting happened last Saturday, April 5th, 2008 at lake Jarun, Zagreb, Croatia.

Ruby on Beers is informal gathering of Ruby users. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hr/browse_thread/thread/dde9f2c93c17fd3e">It all started at</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hr/">ruby-hr</a> Google group (in Croatian) that came to life after the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090417214325/http://barcamp.ini.hr/">BarCamp Zagreb</a> where we realized that there are more than one Ruby user in the near (as I thought before Barcamp).

The four of us appeared. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sloser">Branimir Šloser</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sbrankovic">Saša Branković</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mislav">Mislav Marohnić</a> and me.

We enjoyed excellent Tomislav beer and discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything">the meaning of life, the universe, and everything</a>, and more specifically, what to do next.

The next meeting should be on Saturday, May 10th, 2008. I hope I will be able to talk about <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a>, and there are rumors that there will be something said about <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a>. Only the time will tell.

If you are in the near, please drop by.
