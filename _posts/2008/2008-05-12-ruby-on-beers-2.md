The second Ruby on Beers happened yesterday. About 15 of us appeared, much more than I expected.

We were talking about <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> and <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a>.

We did not have the time to talk about <a href="http://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> and <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, so we will talk about it the next time. There was interest in talking about <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a>.

The next Ruby on Beers will probably happen at the same place (Multimedijalni institut, net.kulturni klub mama, PreradoviÄ‡eva 18, Zagreb), at Saturday May 31st 2008 at 5 pm.
