<p>We were thinking about creating a page with all Watir contributors, and today I had a good enough reason to finally create it.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Contributors">wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/Contributors</a></p>
<p>Since I will not have the time to add all Watir contributors (answering questions at this list, writing documentation, code...), please add yourself to the page, and link to your contribution. If there are lots of them, just to the ones you are proud of. You can also add other people, just do not forget to link to the contribution.</p>
