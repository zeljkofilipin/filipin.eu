title: Log Parser and Batch Files
---
<p>I am using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&displaylang=en">Log Parser</a> to parse log files. I parse a lot of files and I wanted to make a batch file that will do it for me.</p>
<p>I pasted my commands to a batch file, executed it, and to my surprise, it would parse the files but would not find anything.</p>
<p>This is content of my batch file:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
LogParser "SELECT text FROM errors.log WHERE text LIKE '2008-%'"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When I execute it, it does not find anything:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
C:\>parse_logs.cmd
C:\>LogParser "SELECT text FROM errors.log WHERE text LIKE '2008-'"

Statistics:
--
Elements processed: 34
Elements output: 0
Execution time: 0.02 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When I executed the command from command prompt, Log Parser would find what I was looking for:</p>

{% highlight shell %}
C:\>LogParser "SELECT text FROM errors.log WHERE text LIKE '2008-%'"

Statistics:
--
Elements processed: 34
Elements output: 24
Execution time: 0.02 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I looked around, asked a few people but no luck.</p>
<p>I finally found the problem.</p>
<p>There is <code>%</code> in Log Parser SQL query:</p>

{% highlight sql %}
LIKE '2008-%'
{% endhighlight %}

<p><code>%</code> represents variable in batch file, and if you take a closer look how batch file gets executed you will see that</p>

{% highlight sql %}
LIKE '2008-%'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>is executed as</p>

{% highlight sql %}
LIKE '2008-'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I changed batch file to</p>

{% highlight sql %}
LIKE '2008-%%'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>and now it works.</p>
