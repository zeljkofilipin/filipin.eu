title: Get rid Of "Press a key..." While Using Log Parser
---
<p>As I said before, <a href="/log-parser-and-batch-files">I use Log Parser a lot</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that really annoyed me is <code>Press a key...</code> that would appear after each screen of results.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
C:\>LogParser "SELECT text FROM errors.log"
...
Press a key...
...
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It took me some time to get rid of it, so maybe this helps somebody. Use <code>-rtp:-1</code> switch and there will be no more <code>Press a key...</code></p>

{% highlight shell %}
C:\>LogParser -rtp:-1 "SELECT text FROM errors.log"
{% endhighlight %}
