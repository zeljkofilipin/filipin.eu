<p>Blogging again! :)</p>
<p>I had to travel a long way to get to <a href="http://awta.wikispaces.com/AWTA+2009">AWTA 2009</a> in beautiful Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>To see what is going on, the best place is <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23awta">#awta</a> Twitter channel.</p>
<p>I am <a href="http://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">twittering</a>, posting images, blogging and podcasting like crazy.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://awta.wikispaces.com/Notes+from+AWTA+2009">Notes from AWTA 2009</a> you can find a lot of images, notes, podcasts, blog posts, presentations, twitter feed...</p>
<p>It was great to finally meet in person a lot of people I knew on-line for years. I have learned a lot how other people test. Also, Austin and Texas were very interesting to explore. I think all is already said about AWTA 2009. I just hope I will be there the next year too.</p>
