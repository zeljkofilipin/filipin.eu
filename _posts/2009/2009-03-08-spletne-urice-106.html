<p>At <a href="http://barcamp.ini.hr/">BarCamp Zagreb 2009</a> after <a href="/barcamp-zagreb-2009/">my Watir talk</a> <a href="http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog/">Jure Cuhalev</a> asked me if I will present Watir it in Ljubljana (Slovenia) at <a href="http://web.zen.si/">Spletne Urice</a>, weekly gathering of Slovenian geeks held in <a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org/">Kiberpipa</a>. Of course, I said: "Yes!".</p>
<p>Slovenian and Croatian (my mother tongue) are similar, but not similar enough to understand each other, so the talk was in English.</p>
<p>About ten people arrived for the talk, as I expected, but it was a bit more formal that I expected. They pointed reflectors at me, gave me a microphone and said they are recording audio and video, and that there is live video stream. In about a week there should be video file of my talk on their site. As I understood, they also prefer to ask questions at the end of the talk, but I prefer when questions are asked during the talk. It makes it more dynamic. I do not think that the purpose of a talk is to show all slides and say what I prepared, but to answer people's questions, even if it moved the talk in the direction I did not plan it to go.</p>
<p>I talked a bit about <a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/">Watir</a> first, and then about <a href="http://wiki.github.com/scudco/taza">Taza</a>, as an example of Watir framework. I chose Taza among other frameworks simply because it had the best documentation.</p>
<p>As I like to do it, most of my talk was live coding. I would like to thank <a href="http://friedcellcollective.net/outbreak/">Marko Mrdjenoviƒç</a> for holding the microphone while I was coding. My live coding went pretty well while I was in pure Watir, but when I switched to Taza (I am not really familiar with it) I had some problems. With some luck and help from the audience, I was able to get to the end of my Taza example.</p>
<p>After the talk, I took a look (and a few pictures) at their museum of old computers. Most of them are functional and powered up, as you can see from the pictures. They even have my first computer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a>. If you looked really closely, you would see a tear in my eye while I was looking at it. I spent a lot of time playing with it (while I was a kid, not in the museum).</p>
<p>After the museum I joined the rest of the people in a bar where they were drinking beer, but I had to drink tea, because I had to drive for almost two hours to get home. We had a nice but short chat, because it was getting late and I had to head home.</p>
