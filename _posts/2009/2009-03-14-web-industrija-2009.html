<p>The day after <a href="/spletne-urice-106/">Spletne Urice #106</a> I spent the whole day at <a href="http://webindustrija.com/">Web::INDUSTRIJA 2009</a>, a small trade fair in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
<p>Nice people from <a href="http://linux.hr/">linux.hr</a> got a booth there and asked a few local open source groups if they would like to join them. One of the groups they asked was a group I am member of, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hr/">ruby-hr</a> (Ruby Croatia).</p>
<p>I planned to be there a few hours, but my boss said it is fine with him if I spend the whole day there, so I went for that option. :)</p>
<p>There was about ten booths, a pretty small trade fair. Linux.hr team were handing out some <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> CDs, and since I do not know anything else, I was showing people how Watir works. I guess I showed Watir to about 10 people that day. Not bad.</p>
<p>Since Ubuntu has live CD, I tried it on my Mac, and it worked fine. Wireless was not working, and Linux gurus said that Ubuntu probably does not have drivers for my hardware.</p>
<p>There is also a funny story. I was entering the fair and saw a big penguin walking around. Of course, it was one of the linux.hr team, so he approached me and said to follow him to our booth. So, I am walking behind a giant penguin, and at the entrance they ask me if I have a ticket. I said: "<a href="http://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin/status/1283097605">I am with the penguin</a>", and to my surprise they just let me in. I newer thought that knowing a penguin can get you any benefits.</p>
