<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>For more than a year I had a half finished blog post on how to create a podcast site. I never had the time to finish and publish it. Recently I had to create a podcast site and now is the chance to finish it. If I do not do it now, I probably never will.</p>
<p>I have already blogged <a href="http://filipin.eu/2009/10/15/how-to-find-listen-record-edit-and-publish-a-podcast/">on podcasts and podcasting</a> and I just mentioned creating a site. Now I want to get into detail.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting</strong></p>
<p>You can host the podcast at <a href="http://blogger.com/">blogger.com</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> but I would recommend a cheap shared hosting. It gives you way more flexibility. You can host <a href="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a> based site on almost any cheap shared hosting.</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong></p>
<p>Pick a domain. Make it short and relevant to the topic of the podcast. Please do not use www in front of the domain. Also, dashes in domain name are so 2009. I would recommend com domains. For example, a good name for a podcast on Watir is Watir Podcast. It is trivial to create a domain from such name: watirpodcast.com. Both the name of the site and the name of the domain make it clear what is the topic of the podcast.</p>
<p>If you already have a domain (you probably already have a blog) create a subdomain. For example, you have a blog at filipin.eu. The podcast could live at podcast.filipin.eu.</p>
<p>The site I am currently working on is a bit more complicated. Fellow tester, blogger and podcaster <a href="http://testertested.blogspot.com/">Pradeep Soundararajan</a> asked if I could help him with the podcast site. He has a blog at <a href="http://testertested.blogspot.com/">testertested.blogspot.com</a> and I have <a href="http://testingpodcast.com/">testingpodcast.com</a> domain (the site is still under construction, but feel free to take a look), and we settled down for <a href="http://testertested.testingpodcast.com/">testertested.testingpodcast.com</a>.</p>
<p>To create a subdomain, log in to cPanel (or whatever software you get with hosting) and create a subdomain. If you have cPanel, go to <code>Domains > Subdomains </code> and create it.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/domains.jpg"><img src="/assets/domains-300x224.jpg" alt="domains" title="domains" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/subdomain.jpg"><img src="/assets/subdomain-300x199.jpg" alt="subdomain" title="subdomain" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Install WordPress</strong></p>
<p>cPanel has Fantastico script that makes installing WordPress trivial. Go to <code>Software/Services > Fantastico De Luxe > Blogs > WordPress > New Installation</code> and finish the wizard.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/software-services.jpg"><img src="/assets/software-services-300x221.jpg" alt="software-services" title="software-services" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/fantastico.jpg"><img src="/assets/fantastico-300x217.jpg" alt="fantastico" title="fantastico" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/install-wordpress.jpg"><img src="/assets/install-wordpress-246x300.jpg" alt="install-wordpress" title="install-wordpress" /></a></p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://testertested.testingpodcast.com/">testertested.testingpodcast.com</a> and the site is there!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/testertested.jpg"><img src="/assets/testertested-300x239.jpg" alt="testertested" title="testertested" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The site is up, but there is still some work to be done. Please, change the theme. Log in and go to <code>Appearance > Add New Themes</code>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/theme.jpg"><img src="/assets/theme-300x213.jpg" alt="theme" title="theme" /></a></p>
<p>There is so much themes that you will probably spend some time looking for one that you like. I selected Atahualpa from featured themes. When you find the theme you like, you can preview it with <code>Preview</code> and install with <code>Install</code>. After you have installed it, activate it with <code>Activate</code>. Go to the site by clicking <code>Visit Site</code> link at the top of the page. (I usually have administration page in one tab and the site in another tab.)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Atahualpa.jpg"><img src="/assets/Atahualpa-300x212.jpg" alt="Atahualpa" title="Atahualpa" /></a></p>
<p>Much better.</p>
<p>You can configure the theme at <code>Appearance > Atahualpa Theme Options</code>. I do not have any design talent, so I tend not to mess with the theme.</p>
<p><strong>Configure WordPress</strong></p>
<p>There are a few tweaks to WordPress that you should do.</p>
<p>At <code>Settings > Discussion</code> I usually check <code>Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article (slows down posting.) </code> and uncheck <code>Comment author must fill out name and e-mail</code> and I change <code>Comment Moderation</code> to hold a comment in the queue if it contains 1 or more links (the default is 2).</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/settings-discussion.jpg"><img src="/assets/settings-discussion-300x212.jpg" alt="settings-discussion" title="settings-discussion" /></a></p>
<p>At <code>Settings > Privacy</code> I change the setting to <code>I would like my blog to be visible to everyone, including search engines (like Google, Sphere, Technorati) and archivers</code>.</p>
<p>At <code>Settings > Permalinks</code> I set <code>Common settings > Custom Structure</code> to <code>/%postname%/</code>.</p>
<p>At <code>Settings > Miscellaneous</code> I uncheck <code>Organize my uploads into month- and year-based folders</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong></p>
<p>There a few plugins that you just have to have.</p>
<p>Go to <code>Plugins > Installed</code> and activate Akismet. After it is activated you have to enter your WordPress.com API Key at  <code>Plugins > Askimet Configuration</code>. You will need wordpress.com account. Create one if you do not already have it. Go to <a href="http://wordpress.com/profile/">wordpress.com/profile</a> to get your API Key.</p>
<p>podPress is must have plugin for podcasters. To install it go to <code>Plugins > Add New</code> and search for podPress. It should be the first one in search results. As with themes, there is <code>Install</code> link. After the installation, activate it with <code>Activate Plugin</code> link.</p>
<p>Since I am fanatic about knowing all possible statistics, I always install my favorite data gathering plugins. Since you already know how to install and activate plugins, do that for Google Analytics for WordPress. You will need <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> account. Log in and click <code>Add Website Profile»</code> link. Get <code>Web Property ID</code> and paste it to <code>Plugins > Installed > Google Analytics for WordPress > Settings > Analytics Account ID</code>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/analytics.jpg"><img src="/assets/analytics-300x197.jpg" alt="analytics" title="analytics" /></a></p>
<p>FeedBurner FeedSmith is a bit different to install because it is not in WordPress repository. Go to <a href="http://www.google.com/support/feedburner/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78483">Creating your WordPress feed (self-hosted WordPress)</a> and <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/static/feedburner_feedsmith_plugin_2.3.zip">download FeedBurner FeedSmith plugin</a>. Go to <code>Plugins > Add New > Upload</code>, upload downloaded zip file, and activate it after the installation. I received <code>The plugin does not have a valid header</code> error message after the activation, so I unzipped it and uploaded <code>FeedBurner_FeedSmith_Plugin.php</code> to <code>/public_html/testertested/wp-content/plugins</code> with FTP client. Acitivate it at <code>Plugins > Installed</code>.</p>
<p>You will need <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> account. Log in, and paste http://testertested.testingpodcast.com/ in text box under <code>Type your blog or feed address here</code>. Make sure <code>I am a podcaster!</code> checkbox is checked. Click button <code>Next>></code> and finish the wizard.</p>
<p>Go to <code>Settings > FeedBurner</code> and enter <code>http://feeds.feedburner.com/TestingStoriesFromIndia</code> in text box under <code>http://feeds.feedburner.com/yourfeed</code>.</p>
<p>I think we are done with plugins for now.</p>
<p><strong>Podtrac</strong></p>
<p>You will need a good statistics on podcast downloads. Create <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/">Podtrac</a> account (click <code>Podcasters</code>). Log in, click link <code>Register a New Podcast >>></code> and finish the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>Everything is set up, but there is no content. Delete all default links at  <code>Links > Edit</code>. Add link to your blog or site.</p>
<p><strong>Pages</strong></p>
<p>You probably need only one page: About. Add your image and short description of the site there.</p>
<p><strong>Users</strong></p>
<p>Create new users at <code>Users > Add New</code> if you are not the only one editing the site.</p>
<p><strong>Posts</strong></p>
<p>Rename the default <code>Uncategorized</code> category to <code>Podcast</code> at <code>Posts > Categories</code>. Make sure you change both <code>Category Name</code> and <code>Category Slug</code> settings.</p>
<p>Delete the default post at <code>Posts > Edit</code> and add new at <code>Posts > Add New</code>. Enter title and short description of the podcast. Add <code>[display_podcast]</code> where you want the link to the mp3 file to appear. Check <code>Podcast</code> checkbox in <code>Categories</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure to add your small image. I think it is very important. It makes the site more human. While uploading make sure to enter your name in <code>Title</code>, <code>Caption</code> and <code>Description</code>.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/pradeep.jpg"><img src="/assets/pradeep.jpg" alt="Pradeep Soundararajan" title="Pradeep Soundararajan" /></a></p>
<p>Click <code>Add Media File</code> button at the bottom of the page. Paste URL of the podcast prefixed with <code>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/</code> in <code>Location</code> text box. In my example it was <code>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.skilledtests.com/testertested/FIET.mp3</code>. Enter <code>FIET.mp3</code> as file title and click <code>Auto Detect</code> buttons next to <code>Size</code> and <code>Duration</code> text boxes.</p>
<p>Click button <code>Publish</code>.</p>
<p><strong>iTunes</strong></p>
<p>You should submit the podcast to a directory. I would highly recommend to at least <a href="https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/publishPodcast">submit podcast to the iTunes Store.</a> Requires iTunes application to be installed and launched. Also requires logging in to iTunes Store.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/itunes1.jpg"><img src="/assets/itunes1-300x161.jpg" alt="itunes1" title="itunes1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/itunes2.jpg"><img src="/assets/itunes2-300x182.jpg" alt="itunes2" title="itunes2" /></a></p>
<p><strong>podPress</strong></p>
<p>A few final tweaks to podPress.</p>
<p>Go to <code>podPress > Feed/iTunes Settings</code> and enter <code>iTunes:FeedID</code>. It is a number from the end of the podcast iTunes link. You got the link in e-mail from Apple after the podcast is added to iTunes Store. The link looks like http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=346653690 and FeedID is 346653690 in this case.</p>
<p>Enter podcast title, description and feed at the same page. Also, add an image as album art.</p>
<p>Go to <code>podPress > General Settings</code> and select <code>Enable PodTrac Statistics</code>.</p>
<p><strong>The End</strong></p>
<p>I think it is all for now. Feel free to comment. Please let me know if I missed something that should be done, or if I am doing something wrong.</p>
