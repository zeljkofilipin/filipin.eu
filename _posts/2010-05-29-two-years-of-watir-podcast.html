<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>A few days ago it was 2 years since I published <a href="http://watirpodcast.com/1-bret-pettichord-on-watir/">the first Watir Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>In this 2 years I have published 34 podcasts with people literally all over the world. Lately I am trying to produce a podcast a month, and I am trying to keep it about 30 minutes long. I have recorded podcasts as short as 5 minutes, but also longer than 70 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and  <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">FeedBurner</a> say the numbers are (mostly) going up. FeedBurner says about 100 people is subscribed to the podcast feed lately.</p>

<p>The following table lists downloads since December 2009, when I started using <a href="http://podtrac.com/">Podtrac</a>. The first number is total downloads, the second number is unique downloads. Please notice #26. :)</p>
<p>I am glad to see that podcasts as old as 1 or even 2 years are still downloaded.</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>After two years, what to say? It was a lot of fun, I hope it will not end soon.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everybody that wanted to talk with me. I would probably stop recording podcast if I did not have a lot of help from <a href="http://watirpodcast.com/team/">Watir Podcast Team</a>. A big thank you to all of you that co-hosted a podcast, contributed music and logo, worked on the web site, edited audio... I could not do it without you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://pettichord.com/">Bret Pettichord</a> for agreeing to record the first podcast, <a href="http://twitter.com/bluegrasscoder">Alan Baird</a> that worked on the web site, and <a href="http://www.yowsbrain.com/">Gregg Yows</a> that co-hosted a lot of times and contributed a lot of music.</p>
<p>I would probably give up a long time ago if <a href="http://tcfodor.wordpress.com/">Tiffany Fodor</a> did not offer to edit the audio and create show notes. Tiffany, thank you.</p>
<p>Also, a bit thank you to every listener. Yes, you too. Well, if you were not listening, all this would not make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>If you have some time, and you would like to contribute to the podcast, please let me know. I need help with finding guests, co-hosting, I am always looking for music that can be published under a Creative Commons licence... If you would like to take over Watir Podcast, let me know. I would help you with everything. I have other stuff to do, but if nobody is interested, I will not let the podcast die.</p>
<p>I did not mention a lot of people by name, because this blog post would end up being too long. You know who you are. Yes, you. Thanks.</p>
