<p>I was at <a href="http://www.case.hr/konferencije/case22">CASE 22</a> conference this week. It was three day conference, but I was there only the last half of the last day, so I can not say a lot about it. So, I will just mention <a href="http://twitter.com/banovotz">Davor</a> <a href="http://testers.shoutem.com/banovotz">Banović</a>'s talk on usability testing.</p>
<p>Since that is all I know, I talked about <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a>.</p>
<p>It was "old school" conference, looks like I was the only one tweeting (<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23case22">#case22</a> at twitter.com and <a href="http://identi.ca/tag/case22">case22</a> at identi.ca).</p>
