title: Webalizer on Mac OS X
---
<p>Yesterday I spend a few hours trying to install <a href="http://webalizer.darwinports.com/">Webalizer on Mac OS X</a> 10.6 (Show Leopard), with no luck. After some browsing, I found instructions <a href="http://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration">how to migrate MacPorts</a>, but I got stuck with <a href="http://trac.macports.org/ticket/23127">Error: Checksum (md5) mismatch for jpegsrc.v7.tar.gz</a>. Looks like it is fixed, and Webalizer installed with no problems today with just:</p>
<p><code>sudo port install webalizer</code></p>
