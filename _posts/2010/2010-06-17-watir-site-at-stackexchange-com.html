<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/watir-general/browse_thread/thread/f34f8a5fb2631ed7">Recently</a> I have asked if people are interested in creating Watir site at stackexchange.com. I was pleasantly surprised by the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6056/proposal-for-watir-site">number of people that are interested</a>. Just today I have read that <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/area-51-we-come-in-peace/">new stackexchange.com sites can be created</a>, so I have created <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6738/watir?referrer=cBxk1oncaoo1">Watir site at stackexchange.com</a>.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a> software (also used at <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a>) is the best solution for <a href="http://watir.com">Watir</a> support (and almost any other kind of support).</p>
<p>If you think Watir site at stackexchange.com is a good idea, all you have to do is:</p>
<p>- go to <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6738/watir?referrer=cBxk1oncaoo1">Watir site at stackexchange.com</a><br />
- click link "Follow It!"<br />
- enter your e-mail<br />
- click button "Submit"</p>
<p>(I was tempted to write this as a Watir script.)</p>
<p>Optionally, you can add on-topic and off-topic questions, and vote on other questions as on- or off-topic.</p>
<p>Feel free to spread the word on your Twitter/Facebook/blog...</p>
