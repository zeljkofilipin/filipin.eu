Yesterday I was at the first <a href="http://www.amiando.com/rubyatsix.html">Ruby at Six</a>, organized by <a href="http://www.infinum.hr/">Infinum</a>.

About 30 people showed up. Everybody said a few words about themselves, we had a few home brew beers and talked informally.

I said a few words about the conference I am organizing, <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/">viaqa</a>. The first day is general software testing topics, the second day is <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/category/watir-day/">Watir Day</a>. Price? <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/tickets/">Free</a>!

If you want to continue the conversation, go to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hr">ruby-hr</a> Google group or <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23rubyatsix">#rubyatsix</a> at Twitter.
