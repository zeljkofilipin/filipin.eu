<p>I have finished reading <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide">Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a> book today. It took me a while to realize there is free pdf version of the book (and $34.99-$49.49 print and ebook versions).</p>
<p>What is <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>? From their web site:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a nutshell Jenkins CI (formerly known as Hudson) is the leading open-source continuous integration server.</p></blockquote>
<p>The book covers everything you need to know. How to install, use and maintain it. There is also a few chapters about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> in general. I have just scanned chapters on Java specific topics.</p>
<p>I was reading the book and working on setting up Jenkins, just the way I like to learn. First in a virtual machine on my laptop, then on a real server somewhere in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Almost in every chapter I was surprised to learn how powerful Jenkins is. It can do almost anything you need, and all of it can be done from your favorite browser. I plan to write more about how I use Jenkins as soon as I get more experience with it.</p>
<p>At the moment, Jenkins is checking our Git repository every minute. If there are new commits it pulls them and builds the application. If the build is successful it runs a suite of Watir tests. For a while, it was sendin e-mail if build fails to the person that made the last check in. I have disabled it because links in e-mail messages were broken, since Jenkins was installed in a virtual machine on my laptop. I will also investigate distributed builds, if this machine becomes too busy.</p>
<p>The goal is to have automatic builds and one click deploy to production.</p>
<p>At the end, I did not have a lot of trouble installing or using Jenkins, it is pretty straightforward. I had some <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/jenkins-windows-and-git/">Git problems</a>, but managed to resolve them. The majority of the work was in adjusting our rake build script to work with Jenkins.  </p>
<p>In short, if you need a continuous integration server, I would recommend Jenkins. If you want to read a book about it, I would recommend this book.</p>
