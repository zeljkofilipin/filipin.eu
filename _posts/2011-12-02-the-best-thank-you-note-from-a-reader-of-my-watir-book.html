Feedback like this makes me want to spend even more of my time writing the <a href="http://watir.com/book/">Watir Book</a> and giving it away for free*.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for wasting a bunch of my time. Next time, before you publish something you might want to check that it works. I've spent 5 hours trying to get this shit to run and I can't get the dev kit (ruby dk.rb install) to install. A search indicates that I'm not the only one having this issue. WHat a BUSH operation: from Ruby to Watir to YOU. </p>
<p>Please: take your page down  -- stop wasting peoples' time.</p>
<p>On your BEST DAY, you're an IDIOT.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>* I am selling the book, but all content is available on GitHub for free. I have spent hundreds of hours on the book so far, and I have earned about $200. Do the math.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have replied after I updated the instructions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. Since you have asked so nicely, I have just spent another afternoon and evening away from my family, updating instructions on how to install Watir:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/blob/master/installation/windows.md">https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/blob/master/installation/windows.md</a></p>
<p>I did it just for you, for free of course, as always. Please notice new chapter, DevKit.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Željko</p></blockquote>
