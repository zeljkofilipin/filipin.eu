<p>I have read <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Software-Craftsmanship-The-New-Imperative/9780201733860.page">Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</a> by <a href="http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/">Pete McBreen</a>. I liked the book and I want to write this blog post as a reminder for myself that I have read it. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to write a good blog post, so here is just one thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>Software engineering works on really big projects, software craftsmanship works on smaller projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>I like the idea of moving from apprentice to journeymen to master.</p>
