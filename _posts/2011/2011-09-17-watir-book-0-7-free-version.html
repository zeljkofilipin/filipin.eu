title: Watir Book 0.7, free version
---
<p>I have just released Watir Book 0.7 (free version) in PDF, EPUB (iPad, iPhone, iPod) and MOBI (Kindle) format. You can <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/downloads">download the free version of the book</a> from GitHub for free.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WVJATC56MJS3N">buy the whole book</a> via PayPal for 9$. Since the book is not finished yet, you will get all updates to the book for free.</p>
<p>Previous release, 0.6 (July 30) had <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/blob/master/downloads/2011-09-17.png">498 downloads</a>. Release before, 0.5 (July 23) had <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/downloads/2011-04-05.png">55 downloads</a>, and 0.4.2 (June 20) had <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/downloads/2011-04-05.png">292 downloads</a>. I did not keep record of downloads previous to that. All together, 845 downloads. Not bad.</p>
<p>What is new since the last release?</p>
<p>- managed to drive all browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Opera) on all operating systems (Windows: XP, Vista, 7; Mac 10.5, 10.6; Ubuntu 11.04) (with a few exceptions, see <em>problems so far</em> a bit below)<br />
- fixed images at the <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/">GitHub site</a><br />
- removed Ubuntu 10.10 and Firewatir chapters, since I consider them obsolete<br />
- using Ruby 1.9.2 on Windows and Ubuntu<br />
- using build-in Ruby on Mac (1.8.6 on 10.5, 1.8.7 on 10.6)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/commits/master">see all the changes</a> at GitHub.</p>
<p>Problems so far:<br />
- could not drive Firefox 4+ on Mac 10.5, but Firefox 3.6 works just fine<br />
- could not drive Opera on Windows XP (<strong>update</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/commit/cf1eb409fbb32ef9d690eafe59924e208835bb09">fixed</a>) and Mac 10.5 (<strong>update</strong>: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7483686/can-not-drive-opera-with-watir-webdriver-on-mac-os-x-10-5">fixed</a>) (both fixes will be in 0.7.1, should be released this week)<br />
- did not cover Mac 10.7 because I do not have it (if three people buys the book this month, I will buy 10.7)</p>
<p>This is the first version of the book that does not include all chapters that I have written so far, but only those that will get you interested in the book enough to buy it. (I hope.) If you do not want to pay, you can <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook">read the whole book</a> at GitHub.</p>
<p>Everybody that already bought the book (all three of them, so far) will get the whole 0.7 version of the book as PDF, EPUB and MOBI files via e-mail.</p>
