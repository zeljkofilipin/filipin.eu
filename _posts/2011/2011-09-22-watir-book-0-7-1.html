<p>I have released Watir Book 0.7.1 in PDF, EPUB (iPad, iPhone, iPod) and MOBI (Kindle) format.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/downloads">download the free version of the book</a> from GitHub for free.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=WVJATC56MJS3N">buy the whole book</a> via PayPal for 9$. Since the book is not finished yet, you will get all updates to the book for free. If you already bought the book, I have sent it to you via e-mail.</p>
<p>Major changes since the last release:</p>
<p>- driving opera on Windows XP and Mac OS X 10.5</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/commits/master">see all the changes</a> at GitHub.</p>
<p>Release 0.7 (September 17) had <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/watirbook/raw/master/downloads/2011-09-21.png">156 downloads</a>. Not bad.</p>
<p>One person bought the book this month. If two more people buy the book this month, I will buy Mac OS X 10.7 and cover installation for it.</p>
