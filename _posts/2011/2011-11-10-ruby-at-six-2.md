Yesterday I was at <a href="http://www.amiando.com/rubyatsix2.html">Ruby at Six #2</a> at <a href="http://www.infinum.hr/">Infinum</a> (in Zagreb, Croatia), organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/neektza">Nikica Jokić</a>. About 30 people showed up, like <a href="/ruby-at-six-1/">the last time</a>.

There were 4 short talks about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dbulic/nosql-9893253">NoSQL</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/conversionly">Damir Bulić</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">Coffescript</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bjosip">Josip Bišćan</a>, <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">backbone.js</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/tomislavcapan">Tomislav Capan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mislav">Mislav Marohnić</a> was supposed to talk about <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> but I think he changed the title of his talk to "<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zeljkofilipin/status/134336719330885635">except on Internet Explorer</a>". (You had to be there.)

The talks were interesting, but even more interesting were informal conversations after the talks. There was also free homebrew beer. We went home after 10pm, I think that says how interesting the conversations were.

I think this was one of the best meetups I have ever been. The next one will be next month. I hope Ruby at Six will become a tradition.

If you want to continue the conversation, go to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-hr">ruby-hr</a> Google group or <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23rubyat6">#rubyat6</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23rubyatsix">#rubyatsix</a> at Twitter.
