<p>I was at <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2011/10/software-testers-speak-up-meeting-1.html">Software Testers Speak Up Meeting #1</a> yesterday at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a> (in Zagreb, Croatia). It was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Å mid</a>.</p>
<p>It was a good meeting. About 15 of us showed up. We introduced ourselves, talked about what we do, asked questions... After and hour or two talking, pizza arrived but the discussions continued, sometimes in smaller groups or pairs. A really good meeting.</p>
<p>The next one will probably be at the same place in a month or two. We will probably have one or two short 10-20 minute talks the next time. I am really looking forward to it.</p>
