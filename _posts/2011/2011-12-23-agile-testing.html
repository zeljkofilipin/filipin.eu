<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">TL;DR</a>: It is a good book.</p>
<p>I won the <a href="http://www.agiletester.ca/">Agile Testing</a> book in lottery while I was at <a href="http://awta.wikispaces.com/AWTA+2009">The Austin Workshop on Test Automation</a> (AWTA) in Austin, Texas, in January 2009. I have met both authors, <a href="http://lisacrispin.com/">Lisa Crispin</a> and <a href="http://janetgregory.ca/">Janet Gregory</a>, at AWTA and even recorded a podcast about the book. I was planning to read it since then. But, as it usually goes, I had other things to do. I finally decided I will read the book a few months ago, and I was reading it a few pages a day. While reading it, I had to quickly read <a href="/jenkins-the-definitive-guide/">another book</a>, so everything is a bit blurry. A few days ago, I have finally read the book.</p>
<p>Probably the most useful part of the book for me was part 3, the <a href="http://www.exampler.com/old-blog/2003/08/21/">agile testing quadrants</a>. It was introduced by Brian Marick way back in 2003, but I do not think I have heard a lot about it until I found it in the book.</p>
<p>I am pretty bad at book reviews, so I will not go into details. There are a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Testing-Practical-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321534468/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231516857&sr=1-1">reviews at Amazon</a>, if you like to read them.</p>
