<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/45216182/">Zagreb STC MeetUp #2</a>. It was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2011/12/zagreb-croatia-testers-meetup-2.html">Karlo Šmid</a> at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="/software-testers-speak-up-meeting-1/">the first meetup</a> (which was great) I thought the second one could be only worse. But to my great surprise, it was even better than the first one!</p>
<p>About ten of us appeared. Pizza was already there, so we started talking informally while eating pizza. (We even had a snack and refreshment sponsor, <a href="http://calyx.hr/">Calyx</a>.)</p>
<p>Karlo brought a few books, I brought a few and we organized a little library. I think I got a pretty good deal, I borrowed a few good books:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Learned-Software-Testing-Kaner/dp/0471081124">Lessons Learned in Software Testing</a> by Cem Kaner, James Bach and Bret Pettichord</li>

</ul>
<p>(Book reviews coming soon.)</p>
<p>While we were still eating pizza, Karlo had a talk about <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">The Grinder</a>, a Java Load Testing Framework. After that I talked about <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> (automated testing that doesn’t hurt), <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> (making BDD fun) and <a href="http://sikuli.org/">Sikuli</a> (automate anything you see) and how I use them together.</p>
<p>A really important part of every meetup are informal conversations in pairs or small groups, and we also had plenty of those.</p>
<p>A really good meetup. If you have a chance to attend the next one, I would highly recommend it.</p>
