At [Zagreb Software Testing Club #5](/zagreb-stc-5) last week we were playing [The Set Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)). We were talking about automating it, and a few of us had different ideas on how to do it. It looked like an interesting little project, so I have spend a few hours on it. The code is in [set-game-rb](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/set-game-rb) repository and I have recorded a short screencast of one game.
