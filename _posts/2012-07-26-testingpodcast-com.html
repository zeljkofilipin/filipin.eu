<p>Yesterday was a big day for me. I have realized that I have listened to all audio podcasts on software testing that I could find. All 473 of them.</p>
<p>But, let's start from the beginning. I have been listening to podcasts for years, and I have been looking for podcasts on software testing. Since I could not find a site that would list all such podcasts, I have created <a href="http://testingpodcast.com/">TestingPodcast.com</a>. I have started working on the site in December 2009. In the next two years I have been adding more and more podcasts to the site. I had a lot of help from The Three <del>Musketeers</del> Michaels: <a href="http://twitter.com/michael_d_kelly">Michael Kelly</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mkltesthead">Michael Larsen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mensming">Michael Ensminger</a>. In October 2011 Michael Ensminger took over the maintenance of the site.</p>
<p>I did not just add podcasts to the site. I would listen to at least one podcast from a publisher before adding their podcasts to the site. There were a lot of podcasts from some publishers, and I have been listening to the podcasts as I had the time. Yesterday, finally, I have cleared the backlog. I have listened to all of them.</p>
<p>If you know about audio podcast on software testing and you can not find it at the site, please let me know.</p>
<p>Five podcasts are still actively recorded, so the future for podcasts on software testing looks good.</p>
