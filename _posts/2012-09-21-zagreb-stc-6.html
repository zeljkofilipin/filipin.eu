<p>Yesterday I was at <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki">Zagreb STC</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/77674282/">MeetUp #6</a>. As always, it was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Šmid</a> at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a>.</p>
<p>Another great meetup. As usual, there were about 10 of us. Most of us were testers but there were a few developers too. We started with introductions. Everybody said a few words about themselves, what they do in life and what they were testing in the last week. We thought that would take 10-20 minutes, but the introductions were frequently interrupted with a lot of questions, so it lasted for about 90 minutes.</p>
<p>The pizza came about that time so we had a short break. After the break <a href="https://twitter.com/vidonism">Manuel Vidonis</a> gave an introduction to software testing talk (<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81045640/Testiranje%20programske%20podrske.pdf">pdf</a>, <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/81045640/Testiranje%20programske%20podrske_ppt.pdf">slides</a>, both in Croatian). His talk was also frequently interrupted with a lot of questions, so it lasted until the end of the meetup. In the last few minutes Manuel talked about <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/traffic-manager/e0e39137-3f57-42a1-8dd8-a7029effc0c0">Traffic Manager</a>, Windows Phone game that he is developing.</p>
<p>I brought the books that I own and our little <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki/Library">library</a> continues! (I am still reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Edition/dp/0471358460">Testing Computer Software</a> (2nd Edition) by Cem Kaner, Jack Falk and Hung Q. Nguyen.)</p>
<p>Of course there were pizza and soft drinks, thanks to Ericsson Nikola Tesla.</p>
