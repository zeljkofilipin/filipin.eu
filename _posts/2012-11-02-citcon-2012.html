<p>A couple of weeks ago I was at <a href="http://citconf.com/budapest2012/">CITCON Europe 2012 in Budapest</a>. I think about 100 people were there, just enough.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the second day I gave a longer version of my usual <a href="/test-automation-at-homeswap-com/">Test automation at HomeSwap.com</a> talk. If my talk was later in the day I would be nervous most of the day. This way I gave my talk after breakfast and then I had the whole day to enjoy the conference.</p>
<p>A few things surprised me there.</p>
<p>Well, the first thing did not really surprise me, since I was expecting an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>, but this was probably the most unconferency (if that is a real word) unconference that I have attended so far. And I do not mean it in a bad way. Unconferences feed on chaos, and this one turned out really interesting. Schedules were changing all the time, people were using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology#Law_of_two_feet">the Law of Two Feet</a> liberally. I really prefer this type of conference over more traditional ones.</p>
<p>Another pleasant surprise was that the number of women was way higher than usual, <a href="https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel/status/259345359288033281">about 25%</a>. I was in a few sessions where there were more women. I am glad to see that software is becoming more women friendly.</p>
<p>Also, I was surprised to se a lot of people from Romania, and even a few people from all around Europe, Finland, Serbia, Croatia...</p>
<p>Another thing that I did not notice at Croatian conferences are recruiters. After the first day of the conference a friend and I wanted to get some food, but at the exit there were a few recruiters that literally did not let us go until we accepted their credit cards and talked to them for a few minutes. I am not looking for work at the moment, but it was nice to see that companies are actively looking for testers.</p>
<p>In short, it was a good conference. I have heard a lot about how other people do continuous integration and testing, the tools that they use and the problems that they face.</p>
