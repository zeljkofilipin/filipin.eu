<p>After more than a year since the <a href="http://zeljkofilipin.com/watir-book-0-7-1/">Watir Book 0.7.1</a> release I have good news. I have renamed the book to <a href="https://leanpub.com/watirbook">Homebrewer's Guide to Watir</a> and released it at <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a>. A big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/bpettichord">Bret Pettichord</a> for the name. To mark the milestone, I have bumped the version to 0.8.0.</p>
<p>Apologies for not releasing a new version for so long, but life happened. The book was always high on my todo list, but I just did not have the time to work on it in the last year or so. I have some free time at the moment and I plan to release more often in the future. Well, more often than once in a year is not hard to beat anyway.</p>
<p>Release notes say:</p>
<ul>
<li>New or improved chapters: About, Link, Button, Image, Checkbox...</li>
<li>Created table with all supported HTML elements.</li>
<li>A lot of small improvements and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, there is more good news. Suggested price is $9.99, but you can get the book for free! Click <strong>Buy the ebook now!</strong> button and move the <strong>You pay</strong> slider to the left hand side until the amount goes down to <strong>$0.00</strong>. Of course, you can move the slider to the right hand side and pay more for the book. I will not keep the money, all of it goes to <a href="http://watir.com/">Watir</a> project.</p>
<p>Before I have moved to Leanpub I have sold 144 books, and since I count free downloads (from version 0.4.2) all formats (pdf, epub, mobi) and all versions combined (0.4.2-0.7.1) have almost 13 000 downloads! (12 983 to be precise.)</p>
