<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read">TL;DR</a>: Read the book.</p>
<p>Recently I had the pleasure of reading <a href="http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/perf.html">Perfect Software And Other Illusions About Testing</a> by <a href="http://www.geraldmweinberg.com/">Gerald M. Weinberg</a>. Since we both know I am really bad at book reviews, I will just quote a few things from the book that grabbed my attention while reading it, enough to make a note.</p>
<blockquote><p>
p.24: All in all, testing can be exhausting, but it can never be exaustive.<br />
p.26: Imagine you are about to dine at the Testing Buffet. (Testing Buffet!? See TL;DR.)<br />
p.28: Diversifying your test team might find more problems than enlarging your test team.<br />
p.70: Under such a system of measurement, a lousy developer is tester's best friend. (Wondering when this is true? See TL;DR.)<br />
p.76: The only real kind of exhaustive testing is when the tester is to exhausted to continue.<br />
p.135: If you don't care about quality, you can make any schedule.<br />
p.142: The number one testing tool is not the computer, but the human brain.<br />
p.151: There are many ways of testing without involving computers, but no way of testing that doesn't involve using brains.

<p>And one bug in the book (or maybe not, who knows):</p>
<blockquote><p>
p.101: A <strong>white</strong> elephant. (I think it should be <strong>gold</strong> elephant. Elephants!? See TL;DR.)
</p></blockquote>
