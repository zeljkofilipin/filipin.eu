<p>A few days ago I was one of the gests at <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/viaqa-12-teaser-podcast/">Viaqa 12 teaser podcast</a> (in Croatian). <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/">Viaqa</a> is Croatian software testing conference. Crappy name, but great conference! :) (Last year I was one of the organizers, so I am <em>a bit</em> biased.)</p>
<p>This is the third viaqa conference. The first one was viaqa 10 in Osijek, the second one was viaqa 11 in Zagreb and the third, viaqa 12, will be in Varaždin. I hope to see you there.</p>
