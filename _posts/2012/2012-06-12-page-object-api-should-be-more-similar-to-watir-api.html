<p>I have just created <a href="https://github.com/cheezy/page-object/issues/102">issue 102</a> for <a href="https://github.com/cheezy/page-object">page-object gem</a>. After I wrote it, I thought it would be a good blog post too, so I am reposting it here. If you agree, or not, please comment at GitHub issue, not here.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am pretty sure I am not the only one that has experience with watir API, and gets confused because page-object gem uses different names for some page elements.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>HTML</th>
<th>watir</th>
<th>page-object</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>td</td>
<td>td</td>
<td>cell</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>hidden</td>
<td>hidden</td>
<td>hidden_field</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>img</td>
<td>img</td>
<td>image</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>link</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>li</td>
<td>li</td>
<td>list_item</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ol</td>
<td>ol</td>
<td>ordered_list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>p</td>
<td>p</td>
<td>paragraph</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>input type="radio"</td>
<td>radio</td>
<td>radio_button</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>select</td>
<td>select</td>
<td>select_list</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>td</td>
<td>td</td>
<td>cell</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>textarea</td>
<td>textarea</td>
<td>text_area</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ul</td>
<td>ul</td>
<td>unordered_list</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I am all for making the API human-friendly, that is what watir tried to do in the beginning. After a few years we have noticed that people are getting confused with the API that sometimes uses the same names as HTML, and sometimes does not.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you leave the existing API as is and to create aliases for the people that are familiar with HTML and watir APIs.</p>
<p>Example: we should be able to access unordered list with both <code>unordered_list</code> and <code>ul</code>.</p>
<p>For more people thinking page-object API should be more similar to watir API, take a look at Alister's <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2012/06/04/roll-your-own-page-objects/">Roll your own page objects</a> blog post (and comments).</p>
