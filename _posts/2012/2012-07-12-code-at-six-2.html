<p>I was at a local meetup <a href="http://codeatsix.infinum.hr/">Code at Six</a> #2 a month or two ago. I think about 50 people were there. Life was pretty crazy for me recently so I did not have the time to write anything before. There were two short talks. <a href="https://twitter.com/ggrgur/">Grgur Grisogono</a> was talking about JavaScript performance tricks and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomislav_car">Tomislav Car</a> talked how they moved from NoSQL to MySQL. None of the talks were directly connected with the stuff I am working with, but the talks were still pretty interesting. After the official part, there was plenty of time for informal talks. I talked to a few people, mostly about freelancing. I had to leave pretty early, but I have heard that some of them stayed there late in the night. I am glad to see there are more and more meetups like this in Zagreb.</p>
