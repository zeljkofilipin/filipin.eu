<p>Today I have started working for <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. I am really looking forward to working with <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/">Chris McMahon</a>, who had to get up at 5 am today so we could chat for a few hours. I think Chris and I have similar views on software testing and test automation. In the next few weeks I will try to finish projects for other clients, so I could focus on working for Wikimedia Foundation full time. I am sure this will be an interesting adventure.</p>
