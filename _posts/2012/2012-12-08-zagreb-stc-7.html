<p>Last week I was at <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki">Zagreb STC</a> <a href="http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/88338342/">MeetUp #7</a>. As always, it was organized by <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/">Karlo Å mid</a> at <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/hr/">Ericsson Nikola Tesla</a>.</p>
<p>About 10 testers and/or developers attended, as usual. I was late for the meeting so I was not there for the introductions. This time we did not have any formal talks but that does not mean we were sitting there for a few hours in silence. We had more than enough topics to talk about, mostly about software development and testing.</p>
<p>I brought the books that I own and our little <a href="https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/zagreb-stc/wiki/Library">library</a> continues! (I am still reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Computer-Software-2nd-Edition/dp/0471358460">Testing Computer Software</a> (2nd Edition) by Cem Kaner, Jack Falk and Hung Q. Nguyen.)</p>
<p>We had pizza and soft drinks, this time sponsored by my little company.</p>
