title: Caching

<p>At <a href="http://webcampzg.org/">WebCamp Zagreb 2012</a> Alesandro Slepcevic mentioned <a href="http://webcampzg.org/alesandro-slepcevic-sto-developeri-rade-da-nama-hosterima-zakompliciraju-zivot/">caching plugins for WordPress</a>. I have used WordPress for a long time and I have more than a few WordPress sites, but since all of them are pretty low traffic, I have never had to use caching plugins. After the talk I have decided to install a plugin and see how it works. I have decided to try <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> on this blog. I am using a couple of free monitoring services (<a href="http://www.monitor.us/website-monitoring">Monitor.Us</a> and <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a>), so it was just a matter of time to get some data if the plugin helped or not.</p>
<p>The results (for filipin.eu home page) are in. It is pretty obvious that the plugin helped.</p>
