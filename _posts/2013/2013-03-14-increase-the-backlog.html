title: Increase the Backlog!
---
<p>In <a href="/wikimedia-foundation/">October last year</a> I have started working at <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>. Never heard about it? Let me throw some marketing talk at you. This is the foundation's <em>vision statement</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That's our commitment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds pretty cool? But then, a lot of <em>vision statements</em> sound cool.</p>
<p>Let me tell you more about the foundation. It stands behind <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>a global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still does not ring a bell? Long story short, the bigest project of both the foundation and the movement is <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. I am sure you recognise that one.</p>
<p>What is my day job? Most of the time I write browser test automation for <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a>, software that runs Wikipedia. I am really happy to work with some great people, one of them could be familiar to you: <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/">Chris McMahon</a>.</p>
<p>Why am I writing all this?</p>
<p>As Wikipedia content is developed by volunteers, so is MediaWiki. A lot of people are helping us develop MediaWiki, but the number of people that help us test it is smaller by far. We need help.</p>
<p>Every week we have an event as part of <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/QA/Weekly_goals">Weekly goals</a> project. This week is <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/QA/Browser_testing/Increase_the_backlog">Increase the backlog</a> week. What is the event about? The entire week Chris, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:QGil">Quim Gil</a> and me are focused on helping volunteers in writing <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> scenarios. If you are not familiar with Cucumber, this is how a <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/qa-browsertests/blob/master/features/search.feature#L1-L7">scenario</a> looks like:</p>

{% highlight gherkin %}
Feature: Search
  Scenario: Search suggestions
    Given I am at random page
    When I search for: main
    Then a list of suggested pages should appear
      And Main Page should be the first result
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you are not familiar with given/when/then format, <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then">Given when then</a> page at Cucumber wiki has a short but good explanation of the concept.</p>
<p>The goal of the event is to increase number of scenarios at <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/QA/Browser_testing/Test_backlog">Test backlog</a> page. Scenarios from that page will soon be automated. </p>
<p>Yesterday we had and interactive part of the event. We started at 17h UTC with a short <a href="http://youtu.be/dQTHggO--AQ">10 minute presentation by Chris</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/assets/pdf/automated-tests-in-plain-english.pdf">slides</a> are also available.</p>
<p>The rest of the event happened at #wikimedia-dev IRC channel at freenode.net and <a href="http://etherpad.wmflabs.org/pad/p/Browser-automation">Browser-automation</a> <a href="http://etherpad.org/">Etherpad</a> pad.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/increase_the_backlog.png" alt="Increase the Backlog!" /> How the event looked like for the majority of the time.</p>
<p>Chris and I helped volunteers write their first scenario and reviewed the scenarios when they were finished, with suggestions on how they could be improved. Once everybody was happy with a scenario it was moved to <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/QA/Browser_testing/Test_backlog">Test_backlog</a> page.</p>
<p>Six people actively participated in the event by writing scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valerie (<code>valeriej</code>) wrote a couple of scenarios about searching for deleted pages.</li>
<li>Chris (<code>chrismcmahon</code>) paired with <code>rachel99</code> and wrote three scenarios about searching for pages that start with accented characters.</li>
<li>Quim (<code>qgil</code>) paired with Sucheta (<code>sucheta</code>) and wrote a couple of scenarios about searching in namespaces and order of search results.</li>
<li>I (<code>zeljkof</code>) was mostly answering questions and reviewing scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few people joined the channel, asked questions but did not write any scenarios. At least one person did not understand what we are doing. I guess we should make it more clear in the future what the event is about.</p>
<p>Does this sound interesting? The event is not finished, you can still participate for the rest of the week, or any time in the future.</p>
