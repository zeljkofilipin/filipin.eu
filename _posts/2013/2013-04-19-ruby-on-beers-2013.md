A few days ago I was at a merged meetup of a couple of local groups: <a href="http://jszgb-2.eventbrite.com/">JS Zgb drinkup #2</a> + <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ruby-hr/m0bZ_KdkVYM/discussion">Ruby on Beers</a>. As the name suggests, the venue was local <a href="http://www.pivnica-medvedgrad.hr/">Pivnica Medvedgrad</a> brewpub. It was nice to see familiar faces again and talk about JavaScript, Ruby, Selenium, testing, Ruby, working from home and life in general.

The next local meetup is <a href="http://zagorskisoftwaretester.blogspot.com/2013/04/announcement-for-zagreb-stc-10-meetup.html">Zagreb STC #10</a> with <a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a>! See you there.
