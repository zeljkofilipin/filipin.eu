<p>A few days ago I was at <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/">viaqa 2013</a> conference organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/banovotz">Davor Banovic</a> in beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osijek">Osijek</a>. The first half of the day consisted of a few <a href="http://viaqa.mobi/raspored-predavanja-viaqa-2013/">talks</a>. I do not think talk titles are translated to English anywhere, so I will do my best:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stanislav Mihic: Testing and optimisation loading speed of web pages</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/vidonism">Manuel Vidonis</a>: The basics of testing</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/karlosmid">Karlo Šmid</a>: Myths and legends about software testing</li>
<li>Željko Filipin: <a href="/how-mediawiki-software-that-runs-wikipedia-is-tested">How MediaWiki, software that runs Wikipedia, is tested</a></li>
<li>Davor Banovic: Postmodern testing: Is there one big testing story</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part of the day consisted of lightning talks. I was the moderator and I was pretty strict in enforcing the rules. Up to five minutes of the talk, and then up to five minutes of discussion. I do not think we have a list of lightning talks documented anywhere, so here it is (again doing my best with the translations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Manuel Vidonis: Automated vs. manual testing</li>
<li>Neven Kristijan: Development methodologies and testing, experience report</li>
<li>Ivijan Hadija: Stability testing of database queries (tools, optimisations)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/gbokun">Goran Bokun</a>: How to make sure there is enough budget to test, experience report</li>
<li><a href="http://daddystrail.blogspot.com/">Marko Škrabec</a>: Test management tools</li>
<li>Karlo Šmid: Journey to stars</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tplavcic">Tomislav Plavcic</a>: Volunteering for Wikimedia</li>
<li>Željko Filipin: From zero to hero</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the lightning talks were just a few minutes long, but I do not think any of the talks had less than five minutes of discussion. I always had to cut the discussion after five minutes.</p>
<p>I was one of the proud sponsors of the conference. My sponsorship was to buy juices and cookies.</p>
<p>I was really glad to see Tomislav Plavcic at the conference. He has been volunteering for us since <a href="/dorscluc-2013">DORS/CLUC</a> conference.</p>
<p>After the talk a few of us continued to talk over a beer. I would like to thank Davor for organising the conference one more time and for hosting my family and me.</p>
