Unfortunately, I did not get to enjoy the conference much. The first day of the conference I gave my usual [How software that runs Wikipedia is tested](/how-software-that-runs-wikipedia-is-tested) talk. I am always pretty nervous before giving a talk so I did not attend talks, but rehearsing mine. I was not able to attend the second day because I had to be somewhere else.
