This was my second CITCON, and the second one to drive to. I gave my usual [How software that runs Wikipedia is tested](/how-software-that-runs-wikipedia-is-tested) talk, but I was able to give maybe 10% of my prepared talk, there were so many questions during the talk! After the conference I was unhappy that I did not manage to give the entire talk. After thinking about it, I am now happy that I have managed to reply to as many questions. I think it is more important to answer questions than to give a prepared talk.
