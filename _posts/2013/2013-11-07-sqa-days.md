The conference organization was amazing. This was the first and only time the conference has payed for my flight and hotel. Transportation was arranged from the airport to the hotel. Speakers' dinner was amazing. The conference was three days, the first day in English, the rest in Russian. Since I do not speak Russian, I have participated only on the first day. I gave my usual [How software that runs Wikipedia is tested](/how-software-that-runs-wikipedia-is-tested) talk.
