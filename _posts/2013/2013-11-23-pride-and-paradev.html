<p>I have bought <a href="https://leanpub.com/pride-and-paradev">Pride and Paradev</a> book by <a href="http://watirmelon.com/">Alister Scott</a> as soon as it was available, but it has been waiting on my reading list for months. A few weeks ago I have finally found some time to read the book. I was reading the articles on Alister's blog as he was writing the book so I was mostly familiar with the content.</p>
<p>Book subtitle is <em>a collection of agile software testing contradictions</em>, and that describes the book way better than I could. I really like the format. Every topic is covered from two opposing views: why you should do something and why you should not do it. For example, should testers fix the bugs they find, is software testing a good career choice, is it beneficial to attend software testing conferences.... Controversial topic of software testing certifications is surprisingly covered with a short article.</p>
<p>If you did not already read the book, you should. I hope to see more books of the same format. Alister promised to donate 10% of the book proceedings to homeless, but then changed his mind and <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2013/09/29/pride-and-paradev-donation/">donated all the money to Wikimedia Foundation</a> (my employer). All I can say is thanks for the donation! :)</p>
