I was at several CITCON conferences in Europe, and I was one of the local organizers of CITCON Europe 2014. Unfortunately, due to some scheduling conflicts I was able to attend only Friday afternoon and Saturday early morning, and I have missed the majority of the conference. I think this was the first time my one man company was a (small) sponsor of a conference. One of the things I have oranized is craft beer ([Nova runda](http://novarunda.com/) and [Zmajska pivovara](http://www.zmajskapivovara.hr/)) at Friday social hour.
