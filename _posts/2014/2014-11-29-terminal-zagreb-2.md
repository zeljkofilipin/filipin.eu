# TLDR

I was at [Terminal Zagreb Meetup #2](http://www.meetup.com/terminal-zg/events/218693179/) yesterday. [Matija Marohnić](https://twitter.com/silvenon) talked about Git, [Bruno Sutic](https://twitter.com/brunosutic) about tmux and [Robert Petranović](https://github.com/rpetrano) about OpenSSH. The meetup ended with the usual unformal conversations over beers in the nearby brewpub.

# Misc

- There is [Developers Croatia](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devhr/) Facebook group with almost 4k members!
