# TLDR

About three years since the first meetup and after a looong summer break, Zagreb software testing club [meets again](http://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/218698771/)!

# Details

This time at a new venue, [Multimedijalni institut](http://www.mi2.hr/) (net.kulturni klub MaMa).

Presentations:

- [Boris Grginčić](https://twitter.com/bgrgincic): Start of my Watir journey and the problems along the way ([slides](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Start_of_my_WATIR_journey_and_problems_along_the_way.pdf)).
- [Karlo Šmid](https://www.tentamen.hr/): [WHOSE](http://whose.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/), testing skills suported by examples.
- Željko Filipin: Conferences, past ([CITCON Europe 2014](http://citconf.com/archive/zagreb2014/)) and future ([WebCamp Zagreb](http://webcampzg.org/), [viaqa](http://viaqa.mobi/)).

About ten people attended the meetup. About half of the people regulars, the other half first timers, as usual. A good mix.

Our library is still going strong. I usually bring books that are gathering dust on my shelves and meeting participants seem to be happy to give them a good home. Information wants to be free.

After the meetup we tried to have some food and drinks in a nearby pub. We even had the reservation, but we were 15-20 minutes late and our reservation was cancelled. We have decided to try [Advent on Zrinjevac](http://www.adventzagreb.com/index.php/en/events/56-advent-on-zrinjevac). It was a lot of fun, and a lot of really good unformal conversations over susages and really good beer.

# Misc

- [List of common misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) is an iteresing read.
