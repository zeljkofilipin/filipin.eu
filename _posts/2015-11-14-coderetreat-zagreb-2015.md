I had a lot of fun organinizing (with [Peter Zsoldos](https://twitter.com/zsepi)) and participating in a couple of coderetreats, but I do not think I will organize another one. I have other projects I would like to focus on, and I do not think a local coderetreat community is forming. There are plenty of more focused communites and I think people prefer more focused events, like [NodeSchool International Day 2016](/nodeschool-international-day-2016).
