This was my second Test automation bazaar and my third time in Austin, Texas. I have bought a cowboy hat and competed with [Marek](https://twitter.com/_marekj) several times in solving Rubik's cube. We even had a Rubik's cube workshop during lunch. Of course, there were many test automation related talks, too.
