[CzechTest](http://www.czechtest.com/) was a lot of fun. I gave my usual [How software that runs Wikipedia is tested](/how-software-that-runs-wikipedia-is-tested) talk. I was there with a few friends. [Karlo](http://blog.tentamen.eu/) came for the conference, but some of them came just to enjoj beautiful Prague. Karlo and I met a few testers from Serbia at the conference, and we are still in touch with them. The best event of the conference was speakers' dinner on a boat.

I really liked Prague and it's beer. I hope I will return again, but probably not for CzechTest. The conference itself was too corporate for my taste, I prefer peer conferences.
