The first ever [Testival](http://testival.eu/) conference happened in Split, Croatia. (The conference name was previously viaqa.) The conference is mostly open space, with opening and closing keynote. I have participated in several test automation related sessions.

The next Testival is September 23-24 2016 in Rijeka, Croatia.
