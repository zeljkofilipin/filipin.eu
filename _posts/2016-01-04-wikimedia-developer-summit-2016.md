I have been to a few Wikimedia related conferences and hackathons. [Wikimedia Developer Summit 2016](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Developer_Summit_2016) was surprising organized as an [open space conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology), a format I am familiar with and really like. *Make code review not suck* session was the most interesting one.

At the end of the first day we split into smaller groups and went to restaurants for dinner. I really prefer that over going as a big group and overwhelming a restaurant. Of course, I have joined a group that was going to [ThirstyBear](http://thirstybear.com/) brewery. The second day the food and beer was served by [Old Bus Tavern](http://www.oldbustavern.com/).
