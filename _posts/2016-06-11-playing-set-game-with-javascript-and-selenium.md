A few years ago I have automated [The Set Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)) using [Ruby and Selenium](/automating-the-set-game). Since I have learned some JavaScript I have decided to make a JavaScript port. It is at [set-game-js](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/set-game-js) repository and there is a screencast.
