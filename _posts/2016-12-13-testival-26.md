We have spent several years organizing meetups via [Software Testing Club](https://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/) but the time has come to move on. [Meetup #26](https://www.meetup.com/SoftwareTestingClub/events/235775712/) was the last one organized via Software Testing Club, but also the first one organized via the brand new [Testival Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/testival/)!

I was surprised to see that the last meetup was as long time ago as June. I guess everybody was pretty busy.

After the usual short introductions, we had two talks:

- Krešimir Linke, Quality Assurance Manager at Repsly Inc: Test automation of push notifications for Ranorex application
- Ana Prpic, Quality Assurance Analyst at East Coast Product: Why We Love WebdriverIO and You Should Too

We also had several lightnight talks.
