Austin is the first city I have visited outside Europe (in 2009) and I love coming back there. I usually go there every three years, but this time I have visited it two years in a row. I hope that will continue. I had a small role in [organization](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/test-automation-bazaar-austin-2016-tickets-19830142490), mostly helping with introduction and closing talks. I have led a session about our [JavaScript + Selenium](/javascript-selenium) effort and heard about [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/). I was really excited to try it, but I have gave up since it has Java dependency. :(

I was glad to see old friends again, and also to finally meet [Alex Rodionov](https://twitter.com/p0deje), I know him for years from the internets.
