I have been to a few European [CITCON](http://citconf.com/) conferences. Last month I was in [Cluj-Napoca, Romania](http://citconf.com/archive/cluj2016/).

Since I knew a few people there will be beer lovers like me, I have organized [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) meeting. We have sampled the best Croatian beers I could find and some pretty good local beers.

There were a lot of interesting sessions, but maybe the most interesting was *Frustrated? Change your words to change minds - starting with yours!*

I was leading a session on [Selenium and JavaScript](/javascript-selenium). I have also participated in an interesting session on mentoring and coaching.
