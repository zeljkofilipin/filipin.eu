I am feeling very proud wearing my [DORS/CLUC 2009](/dors-cluc-2009) T-shirt. :D Random idea: a place to put jackets would be nice.

There are a lot of papers in the conference bag, but the only really interesting is [Free Your Android](https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html). Pretty interesting exhibition in the hall. Check the photo gallery for details.

# Day one

**The long way to empower people to control technology, Matthias Kirchner**

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10154160037357290%26set%3Da.10154159840722290.1073741906.735252289%26type%3D3&width=500" width="500" height="380" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

Interesting stories about his work with [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://fsfe.org/) and fighting for open standards and free software in government. Free your Android is probably the most interesting to me. Also, asking governments to include links to open source PDF reader, not just to Adobe Reader.

**Alpha2Omega: Open Source Software in In-Vehicle Infotainment, Dorian Ivančić**

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10154160302777290%26set%3Da.10154159840722290.1073741906.735252289%26type%3D3&width=500" width="500" height="502" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

Story about how [Rimac Automobili](http://www.rimac-automobili.com/en/) uses open source. Interestingly, they are not making money on their fancy cars, but by selling services and parts to other manufacturers. Fancy cars are just for marketing. The most interesting talk of the conference so far, and there were tons of questions after the talk. It is great to see that such cutting edge technology is developed in Croatia.

**LibreItalia and Italian best practices of migration to LibreOffice, Sonia Montegiove**

Meh. :\|

**LibreOffice moves online, Ozcan Esen**

An overview of the technology of online version of LibreOffice. I was not even aware that there is such a thing. Cool.

**Infrastruktura VoIP, Davor Jovanović**

Technical details of VoIP installation for a big local educational institution.

**Open Source Hardware, why we do it and why it matters, Tsvetlan Usunov**

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10154161057742290%26set%3Da.10154159840722290.1073741906.735252289%26type%3D3&width=500" width="500" height="464" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

[DIY OSHW Laptop Kit 2015-2016](https://olimex.wordpress.com/tag/laptop/) is the most interesting thing. I did not really think about picking a license for your open source hardware project. Interesting.

**Make your web solutions more flexible with layout and block management, Ivo Lukač**

I did not really get this talk. According to the questions from the audience after the talk, I was not the only one. In short, the talk was about design and development of complex sites.

**REST API - iskustva iz prakse, Denis Kranjčec**

An overview of REST and how it is used in a big local educational institution.

**Free Technology, Free Societies, Aaron Seigo**

A quote from the talk: "Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past." is from [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingsoc) by George Orwell. I did read a book, but it was a while ago. I remember the quote from [Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testify_%28Rage_Against_the_Machine_song%29). :)

**Docker Security, Vlatko Košturjak**

The basics of Docker and it's security. In short, it is pretty secure by default, but there are additional things that you could and should do to make it even more secure.

# Day two

**Go and The Art of Software Development, Aaron Seigo**

I was expecting the talk would be about [Go (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29), but it was about [Go (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29).

**Fault tolerant services with Corosync and Pacemaker, Marian Marinov**

Meh. :\|

**Iskustva u korištenju GITLaba, Dubravko Penezić**

Surprising thing is that they started switching from SVN to Git as late as 2013.

**Where are women in Fedora?, Jona Azizaj**

The talk reminded me of a project I was working on with an old lady. It was really interesting to be in a deep technical conversation with a lady that could be my grandma.

**Uporaba Mahare u izradi e-portfolia djelatnika, Ana Ćorić Samardžija i Zvonko Martinović**

Meh. :\| I came for lightning talks, but the track was running late.

**Lightning talks**

I love lightning talks.

Using robotics to improve education. The best talk of the conference. Great topic, great delivery, great speaker.

You can [play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs) [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) (and other old games) in [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs).

**Breaking the Internet of Things, Tonimir Kišasondi**

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10154164476387290%26set%3Da.10154159840722290.1073741906.735252289%26type%3D3&width=500" width="500" height="464" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

On security of internet of things. It's bad. He was accepting anonymous questions via web form, and the results are as expected. :)

**Automated testing, a normal part of developer life in the world of agile development, Hans de Raad**

The title sounded really interesting, but the talk was meh. :\| The best part was this joke.

**Let's hack cheap hardware - 2016 edition, Dobrica Pavlinušić**

I could not care less about the topic but Dobrica is such a good speaker, his talks are always amazing. :) Most of the cheap hardware can be hacked and made to do interesting things.
