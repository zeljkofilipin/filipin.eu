After the first day of [DORS/CLUC 2016](/dors-cluc-2016), there was [OWASP meetup](https://www.facebook.com/events/475076512695702/) at the same venue, so I have decided to stay.

**(In)security of Croatian Internet space, Marko Stanec**

How [CERT](http://www.cert.hr/) handles security incidents. Very interesting talk, with a lot of discussion during the talk. As any good security talk should end with, it was mentioned that there is no absolute security.

> The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards - and even then I have my doubts. - Eugene H. Spafford

**OWASP news, Vlatko Košturjak**

An overview of [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) project and what is new. I have heard several talks about the project so far, and I always learn something new. Tonimir Kišasondi talked about OWASP IoT top 10. In short, it's bad. They have also talked about local OWASP community.
