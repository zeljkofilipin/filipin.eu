A couple a days ago, I was at [NodeSchool International Day](http://nodeschool.io/international-day/) organized by local [JavaScript group](http://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-Zagreb/). There were 20-30 participants and 5-10 mentors. We were working on [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) workshoppers. I was working on [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode). It was fun connecting with local JavaScript community and it was useful to have mentors when you get stuck, but I usually work from home and it was really difficult for me to concentrate there. There was always something going on. At one point I have even put my headphones and played [Jeff Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Beck)'s Live + album.

I got a couple of book recommendations, [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).
