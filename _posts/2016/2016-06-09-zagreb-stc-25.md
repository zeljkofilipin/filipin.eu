After the usual short introductions, Karlo reminded us [how to take better notes](http://www.wikihow.com/Take-Better-Notes). Then, we watched an episode of [Elementary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_%28TV_series%29) (a Sherlock Holmes series). We were taking notes, paused every few minutes, compared notes and tried to guess who the killer is. It was very hard to take notes since the episode was really interesting and a lot of things were going on, so I had to watch the screen almost the whole time. For the next time, maybe it would be better to watch a short conference talk (like [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/)), since you can get the most of the talk by listening and taking a look here and there at the slides, if there are any, so there is plenty of time to take notes. I hope there will be a similar session at our upcoming [Testival](http://www.testival.eu/) conference.
