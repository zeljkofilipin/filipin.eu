[Wikimania 2016](https://wikimania2016.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) was my second Wikimania. I was focused on [Language Screenshots](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Language_Screenshots), similar to the previous Wikimania. This time Amir Aharoni and I gave a short demo of the tool during [Hackathon Showcase](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T132719).

There were good talks, a few highlights: The coolest projects of Wikimedia Chapters - be inspired; Projects: Wikisource, Wikivoyage, OSM; Edit button; Translations; Wikipedia to the Moon. I have also participated in several workshops: Content Translation, Basic Wikipedia, Lua, Improving the photographic skills of wikimedians.

There was also [Untappd](https://untappd.com) meeting for beer enthusiasts.
