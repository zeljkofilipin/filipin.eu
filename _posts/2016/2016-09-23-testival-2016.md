Testival is one of my favorite conferences. Like [Test Automation Bazaar](/test-automation-bazaar), it follows [CITCON](/citcon) format. This year the conference was in Rijeka, Croatia.

After short introduction, we have proposed topics.

I have proposed a few sessions:

- Selenium
- How to fail at test automation
- Don't go to conferences
- Career development
- Freelance the hard way

I was not expecting that many of my topics will get enough votes, but surprisingly, the first three made it. I have participated in several sessions, I will mention a few:

- Selenium: My session was merged with a similar one, so the two of us gave an overview of Selenium project, with code examples.
- Game of set during lunch break: It was a lot of fun.
- How to fail at test automation: Stories of failed test automation projects.
- Don't go to conferences: Tips on how to better use time and money to advance your career, instead of going to conferences. Also, if you decide to go to a conference, how to get the most out of it.

Keynotes were good, but I prefer sessions to talks.

After the conference, we went to PEEK&POKE computer museum. As you can see from the photos, we had a great time.

TODO for next year:

- Lightning talks are the only track after lunch, 30-60 minutes.
- Prepare a few lightning talks. (I love lightning talks.)
