This was the second time I have read [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) by Douglas Crockford. 📖📖 I am not sure if I have finished it the first time I was reading it. The first time I did not learn much because it was way over my head. This time I have learned more, but the book is still over my head. I should read it again in a year or two. ⏳

# Review

It has been a couple of years since I have reviewed a [book](/book) here. 😱 I have read plenty of books since. More than 60 in [2016](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016) alone. I am trying to be better about at least recording the books I have read (see [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/zeljko_filipin)). Most of the time I just rate the book 1 ⭐️ to 5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 stars. I will try to write at least a sentence about each book at Goodreads.

Not all books deserve a review, but this one does. I have bought it in early 2013, almost four years ago. I remember reading it then. It was so over my head. There is a chance I did no finish reading it, since I did not write a review, but also, I did not review many books I have read...

I have not written a lot of JavaScript in the last four years. In fact, I have started using JavaScript in the last year. With a few months of experience, I have decided it is time to read a few books on the language. Since I have already owned the book, it was the first one to be read. The book is still over my head, but not so much any more. If I had to provide a number (whatever it meant), the first time it was about 80-90% over my head, this time about 50%. Progress. It will be better the next time I read it.

While reading the book, I was occasionally tweeting. (See the tweet's replies too.)

I have also created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/javascript-the-good-parts) for the book, so I could post the code written while reading the book there. Except for the initial commit, I did not write any code.
