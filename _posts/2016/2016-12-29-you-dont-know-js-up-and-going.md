[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS): Up & Going by Kyle Simpson was more suitable for my level of JavaScript knowledge ðŸ‘¶ than [JavaScript: The Good Parts](/javascript-the-good-parts). It is the first part of the six part series. I have learned some new things ðŸ˜Ž and got confused about some things. ðŸ¤”

# Review

The book is short and more an introduction on what will be covered in the rest of the series, but it does cover the basics. As usual, I have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/you-dont-know-js-up-and-going) for code written while reading the book. The majority of the code in the book was in snippets that could be executed in browser developer tools console. There was only one exercise in the book, so I have created only one file. I was expecting there will be more exercises where I would test myself on what I have learned.
