I like numbers 💓 so I have collected some numbers from 2016. For comparison, I have also included data from previous years. There is a story behind the numbers, but I have spent the time for this blog post collecting the numbers, so the story will have to wait. ⏳ Also, the notes I have are not perfect, I know a lot of runs are missing from 2002, and I have surely read more than one book a year before 2015. 🤔
