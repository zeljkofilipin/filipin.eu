We had a last minute cancellation so there was only one regular talk, Marko Kruljac on "Integrating Jenkins with your GitHub Pull Request Workflow".

After the break, there were a few lightning talks. I have started with "Unicode + Emoji = ⁉️" or "[👱 + 🍳 = ⁉️](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html)". (It's 👨‍🍳.) Vilim Stubičan talked about learning and in the same time solving Rubik's cube. Impressive. Karlo Šmid talked about notebooks.
