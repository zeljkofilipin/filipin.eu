# Talks

Ana Prpic talked about page objects in WebdriverIO and Sandi FatiÄ‡ about continuous integration and Jenkins. I was talking about [Selenium + JavaScript = ğŸ˜•ğŸ¤”ğŸ˜³](/selenium-javascript) and how to [make a game in 5 minutes with Scratch](/scratch).

It's almost like our meetup is turning into JavaScript/Selenium/WebdriverIO meetup, but looks like that is on people's mind recently.
