We have been organizing meetups [since 2011](http://www.testival.eu/zagreb-software-testing-club/) and in all those years the usual meetup was 10 people. This year we have created [Testival meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/testival/) and changed the venue, and the meetups have doubled to about 20 people. This time we even had more speakers than time, so Zoran have shortened his talk to 5 minutes. I hope he will give the full talk the next time.

# Regular Talks

- Dario Đurić: Testing Web Components
- Marko Elezović: Concurrent integration testing
- Marko Varat: UX Testing - Product Development Sanity Check

# Lightning talks

- Krešimir Linke: How we hired a senior tester in the time when everybody else is hiring too
- Željko Filipin: [Selenium bindings in Scratch](/selenium-scratch), visual programming language for kids
- Zoran Majstorović: Ruby Testing Tools (RSpec and Capybara) @ButterflyMX
- Karlo Šmid: Ministry of Testing TestSphere cards and possibilities how to use them

I was really looking forward to giving Selenium bindings in Scratch talk. I have spent a lot of time on that. :)
