Another Testival conference is behind us, this time in Zadar, Croatia. [Alex Rodionov](https://twitter.com/p0deje) gave a great keynote titled Testerâ€™s Anxieties. The rest of the conference was organized as the usual, open space. During lunch we were playing card games and after lunch was a block of lightning talks.

I was participating in several sessions and leading [Selenium + JavaScript = ðŸ˜•ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜³](/selenium-javascript) and [Make a Game in 5 Minutes with Scratch](/scratch) sessions. Of course, I gave a few lightning talks too.
