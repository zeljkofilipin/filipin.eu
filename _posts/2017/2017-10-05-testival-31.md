This was the first time the meetup was at Degordian. There were a couple of regular talks, [Improving love-hate relationships between developers and testers](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/testival/blob/master/files/31/Improving%20the%20love-hate%20relationship%20between%20devs%20and%20QA.pptx) by Vilim Stubiƒçan and [Security testing web API-s](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/testival/blob/master/files/31/API%20Security%20Testing.pptx) by Marko Kruljac. We have ended with a few lightning talks. I gave a lightning talk on career development. (Blog post coming soon.)
