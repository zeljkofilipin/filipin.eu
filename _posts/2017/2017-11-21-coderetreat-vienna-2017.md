I was the main organizer of a couple of [Coderetreats in Zagreb](/coderetreat) in 2014 and 2015. I got busy with other things so I had to give up organizing. I still wanted to attend one, so this year I decided to go to [Global Day of Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/) 2017 in [Vienna, Austria](https://techtalk.at/trainings/global-day-of-coderetreat-2017/?lang=en), organized by TechTalk GmbH.

Unlike Coderetreats in Zagreb, that were focused on implementing [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), we were working on a couple of code catas, [Tennis](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) in the morning and [GildedRose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) in the afternoon.

In one session we were encouraged to try a new test tool. I have tried [TextTest](http://texttest.sourceforge.net/). (It has been a long time since I have found something hosted at SourceForge. I thought it does not exist any more.) The tool is really interesting, but not something I would use.

I have also heard about several interesting way of practicing programming: [cyber‚Äëdojo](http://cyber-dojo.org/), [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/) and [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/).

While writing this post I have noticed that TechTalk also organize (or sponsor, or both) [Citcon Europe 2018 in Vienna](https://techtalk.at/trainings/citcon-europe-2018/?lang=en). (I already have a ticket.) It's a small world! üåç
