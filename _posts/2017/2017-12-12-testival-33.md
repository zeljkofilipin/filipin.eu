This time we had two regular talks:

- Karlo Smid: How to come up with test ideas using lateral thinking
- Ana PrpiÄ‡: Selenium... How it came to be, what does it do, and how to use it.

I gave Hilarious Vim lightning talk. It's a collection of Vim jokes. I have to work more on it.

We already have two regular talks and one lightning talk announced for [Testival Meetup #34](https://www.meetup.com/testival/events/245700306/)!
