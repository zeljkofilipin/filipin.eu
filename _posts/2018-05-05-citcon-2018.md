title: CITCON 2018, Vienna, Austria
---
Last month I was at [CITCON](/citcon) (Continuous Integration and Testing Conference) conference, for the fifth time. This time it was in [Vienna, Austria](https://citconf.com/vienna2018/). CITCON is one of my favorite conferences and Vienna is one of my favorite cities to visit. I always struggle with taking notes during events, but this time I have some notes. I will do my best to write a post from them. 📝

The session day started with remote work session. I work from home for more than a decade, so I like to learn new things and share my experience.

The second session was on [teal organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations) ([teal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal) is a blue-green color). I have stumbled upon this session, none of the other sessions captured my attention. I did not know about the color or that type of organization. Very interesting discussion. *Eight Behaviors for Smarter Teams* was recommended reading. One quote I captured was: "Feeling wrong feels like feeling right."

During lunch I went downtown and bought an ukulele. 🎸

After that I went to *Frustrated? A gentle, loving punch in the face* session. That's always an interesting experience. I have been to that session in [2016](/citcon-2016) too.

For penultimate session I have picked [nonviolent communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication). Once more, I knew nothing about the topic before the session.

The last session was on career development. I have proposed the session since I am very interested in it. I have many notes on the topic and I hope I will have the time in the next few days or weeks to write about it.

During closing session everybody shared an [aha moment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aha_moment) and I have realized that this time I went to exclusively non-technical sessions. It was not on purpose.

I got several LinkedIn requests during the conference. That was a surprise. I had business cards, but people preferred to connect on LinkedIn.
