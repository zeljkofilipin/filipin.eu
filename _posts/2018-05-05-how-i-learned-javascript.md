title: How I Learned JavaScript
---
I have been using Ruby for a long time. The oldest blog post I have tagged Ruby is from [2005](/kako-znas-da-si-napisao-dosta-ruby-koda-za-danas) (in Croatian). In [2015](/javascript) I have started using JavaScript. Several people in the last few months have asked me how I learned it. I have some notes, e-mails and posts, so I thought it might be useful to write a post about it.

# Online Courses

I have finished JavaScript course at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and several [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/) workshoppers.

# Events

I went to [NodeSchool International Day 2016](/nodeschool-international-day-2016) organized by local JavaScript group. It was a good networking experience and I got a couple of good book recommendations.

I gave [Selenium + JavaScript = 😕🤔😳](/selenium-javascript) talk several times.

# Books

I have read several books.

[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke. Very good book, covers most of the stuff a beginner should know. Recommended. Rating 4/5.

[You Don't Know JS](you-dont-know-js-up-and-going) (book series) by Kyle Simpson. I have only read [Up & Going](/you-dont-know-js-up-and-going). It's a good introduction to the language. I think the series would get a better rating, but since I have read only the first book, and it was pretty basic, it got rating 3/5.

[JavaScript: The Good Parts](/javascript-the-good-parts) by Douglas Crockford. I have read it two times in the last few years. Both times it was over my head. I would not recommend it for beginners. Rating 3/5.

# Code

You can not lean a language without solving problems with it. One of the projects I created is [Playing Set game with JavaScript and Selenium](/playing-set-game-with-javascript-and-selenium). I also create a [Git repository](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin?tab=repositories) for each book. If the book has exercises, I store the code I write in the repository, [zeljkofilipin/eloquent-javascript](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/eloquent-javascript) for example. I also have repositories for online courses, [zeljkofilipin/javascripting](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/javascripting) for example. I write code as part of my job. Examples are [wikimedia/mediawiki](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/commits?author=zeljkofilipin) and [macbre/nodemw](https://github.com/macbre/nodemw/commits?author=zeljkofilipin).
