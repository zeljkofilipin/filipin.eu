Just one regular talk this time. Aleksandra Pijuko and Marko Kruljac: Testing a tester - selections process at Degordian. My guess is that the half of the talk was discussion. I think it means that the topic was interesting.

Lightning talks:

- Marko Elezovic: Property based testing in Scala.
- Vilim Stubican: Asking "why"?
- I talked on [git-bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect).
