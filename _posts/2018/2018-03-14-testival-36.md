Regular talks:

- Davor BanoviÄ‡: Acceptance test driven development. Is it a myth?

The best quote from the talk:

> All good tests must come to an end.

Davor mentioned [Chinese number gestures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_number_gestures). I did not know that Chinese have a way of showing numbers 0-10 using just one hand. He mentioned it as an example of possible misunderstandings. With [two extended fingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chinesische.Zahl.Acht.jpg) some people might intend to show number 2, but Chinese might understand it as number 7. I liked it so much, that I found an article about it and had a lightning talkl

Lightning talks:

- Karlo Smid: What I learned on European Testing Conference 2018
- Marko Kruljac: Practice your testing skills by playing board games
- Å½eljko Filipin: Chinese number gestures

We are always looking for better ways of timing lightning talks, and KreÅ¡imir Linke sad [Google has a good timer](https://www.google.hr/search?q=timer). We have tried it and it works great in Chrome in full screen. Full screen does not work well in Firefox ðŸ˜¢ and it is not available in Chrome on Android. ðŸ˜¢

See you in April at [Testival Meetup #37](https://www.meetup.com/testival/events/248535507/)!
