title: Practical Vim by Drew Neil

I read a lot of books, [50-150 in a year](https://www.goodreads.com/zeljko_filipin). A lot of those are audiobooks, a lot are books for kids, but some of them are work related, like [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition). For every book I have read in the last few years, I have an 1-5 rating and at least one sentence written. Work related books deserve a few more sentences here.

I've been using Vim [since 2014](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/commit/a21f4bb5834695dafba64e7c59a05694eaf52fdc). I've started reading this book in December 2017, so it took me almost a year to finish it. The book is divided into more than a hundred tips. I was reading a tip or two a day, or about 10 minutes.

Now that I've read the entire book, I'll be referring to specific tips from time to time, as I need them. I'm looking forward to reading [Modern Vim](https://pragprog.com/book/modvim/modern-vim).
