Regular talks:

- Niko Mađar: How to test with limited resources / getting meaningful results fast and planning for failure
- Alexander Todorov: Kiwi TCMS: past, present & future - an introduction to an open source test case management system

Lightning talks:

- Željko Filipin - [Geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching)

This was the first time in a new venue, [Lemax](https://www.lemax.net/). After the meetup, a couple of people joined me in finding a nearby geocache. On our way home, Karlo and I have found a tricky geocache located at a tree. Some climbing was required.
