Early in 2019 I have visited San Francisco for business. I've been there a few times, but there's always something new to see and experience. I've got introduced to [Geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching) (I am yet to find my first cache without help), read a hilarious comic on software security in craft brewery, saw a coffee bar operated by a robot, took a ride in a [cable car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_cable_car_system), saw a self driving car on the street and finally managed to continue my normal running routine even when traveling.
