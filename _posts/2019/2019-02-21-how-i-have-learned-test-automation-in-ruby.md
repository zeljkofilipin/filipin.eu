title: How I Learned Test Automation in Ruby
---
I've talked with people several times on how to get started on testing, test automation and Ruby, so I've decided to document it. It is mostly influenced by how I have learned it. It was years ago, so other resources might be available now.

# Testing

Both books are short but highly recommended.

- [Perfect Software And Other Illusions About Testing](https://leanpub.com/perfectsoftware) by Gerald M. Weinberg
- [Lessons Learned in Software Testing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/599997.Lessons_Learned_in_Software_Testing) by Cem Kaner, James Bach and Bret Pettichord

# Ruby

- [Everyday Scripting with Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/bmsft/everyday-scripting-with-ruby) by Brian Marick - highly recommended.
- [Programming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby4/programming-ruby-1-9-2-0) by Dave Thomas, with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt - I have probably read the first or the second edition, or both. A very good introduction to the language.

# Test automation

- [Cucumber & Cheese](https://leanpub.com/cucumber_and_cheese) by Jeff Morgan  - opinionated but very good book on how to set up test automation project.
- [The Selenium Guidebook](https://seleniumguidebook.com/) by Dave Haeffner - I have not read it (yet), but I have found myself frequently visiting related [newsletter archive](http://elementalselenium.com/tips).
