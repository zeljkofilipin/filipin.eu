In April 2019 I have visited Chicago for bussines. It was my first visit. I've been to the 103rd floor (!) of Willis Tower observation deck ([Skydeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Tower#Skydeck)), had a hot dog at my first ever baseball game (I'm still not sure I know the basic rules), tried [Chicago-style pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_pizza), had a lot of fun at [Museum of Science and Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Science_and_Industry_(Chicago)) (including visiting a submarine) and took a look at [Lake Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan).
