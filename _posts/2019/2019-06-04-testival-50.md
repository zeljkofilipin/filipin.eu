I'm writing this a few months after the event. I took some notes during the event, so I don't have to write from memory. I've counted almost 40 people at the event. I don't think we have any official stats, but that is probably a record. We were the first time in a new venue, [Infinum](https://infinum.co/). The first talk was a video conference. I think that's the first time we've had a video conference at a meetup. I do remember having a video conference during a Testival conference in Varaždin many years ago.

Regular talks:

- Alan Richardson - EvilTester: Automating Pragmatically
- Ana Šekerija (Infinum) - Why QA and DA need each other

Lightning talks:

- Željko Filipin - [Deploying Wikipedia](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_deployment/Train_deploys)
