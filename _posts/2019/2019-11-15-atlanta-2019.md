I've been to Atlanta in November of 2019. I was there for Wikimedia Technical Conference and team offsite.

Conference was a lot of fun. I had a talk - System level testing: patterns and anti-patterns with Selenium ([task](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T234635), [slides](/assets/pdf/system-level-testing-patterns-and-anti-patterns-with-selenium.pdf)). For un-conference part I've suggested a couple of talks. Selenium workshop ([task](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T238269)) and Ukulele to Wikitext ([task](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T238290)). Selenium workshop got 2 votes, so it was not scheduled. Ukulele to wikitext got 9 votes, so it was scheduled. Lesson learned: submit trolling sessions, not serious ones.

I've been to [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention), [Georgia Aquarium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Aquarium), [World of Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Coca-Cola) and NBA game (Atlanta Hawks vs Milwaukee Bucks). I've tried some of the local food, including famous barbecue and deep fried cheesecake. I've also found a few geocaches near the hotel and had a few runs around a nearby lake.
