In June of 2019 I was contacted by organizers of Zagreb Tech Sauna to give a talk at their meetup. We've scheduled the talk for December. I've suggested a few topics and they have picked Software Testing Anti-Patterns ([slides](/assets/pdf/software-testing-anti-patterns-zagreb-tech-sauna.pdf)).

At work, we have recently read the excellent Software Testing Anti-patterns blog post by Kostis Kapelonis. We had a great discussion about the post. I've noticed that I'm frequently referring to anti-patterns from the post in discussions.

I was a bit nervous so I've forgot to take any photos, but there's a few at their Facebook page. I'm pretty happy that I've managed to use my ukulele in the talk.
