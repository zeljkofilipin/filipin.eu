title: QTE office hours
---
There's been some team refactoring at work. I've been a member of [Release Engineering Team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Release_Engineering_Team) for years. Recently I've moved to a newly formed [Quality and Test Engineering Team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Quality_and_Test_Engineering_Team) (QTE). The team had it's first office hours. The topic was software testing anti-patterns ([slides](/assets/pdf/software-testing-anti-patterns-qte-office-hours.pdf)). It was more of a discussion than a talk. I gave a similar talk recently at [Testival](/testival-56) and [Tech Sauna](/zagreb-tech-sauna) meetups. Blog post is coming soon.
