In 2012 I've [started](/filipin-obrt-started) a one-man company. I was freelancing for a few years. Also in 2012, I've started working full time as a contractor at the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), of [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) fame.

In 2020 the Wikimedia Foundation insisted that all international contractors are converted to employees, via a third party. So, I'm still not an employee of the Wikimedia Foundation, but I'm an employee of a company. I didn't need my own company, so I've closed it.

It was not easy running a company, even a one-man company. It wasn't hard tool, to be honest. I've learned a lot and I had a lot of fun.
