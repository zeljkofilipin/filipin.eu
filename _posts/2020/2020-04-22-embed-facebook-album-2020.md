title: Embed Facebook Album in 2020
---
In 2018 I wrote a blog post on [embedding Facebook albums](/embed-facebook-album). Of course, Facebook changed and the instructions no longer work. I've found a workaround but I didn't have the time to update the post, or write a new one. I wouldn't probably write an update if the original post isn't constantly one of the most popular posts on my blog. 😁

The easiest way is to go to `Timeline > List View`.

Then click `... > Embed` for an album.

`Embed this Post` screen with the code will open.

The only caveat is that all photos must be from the same day. If you have an album with photos from several days, then you'll either need to change photos dates or embed each day separately.
