title: Engineering Productivity Virtual Offsite May 2020
---
In May 2020 we were supposed to have a team offsite in Lisbon, Portugal. I was planning to visit Portugal with my family for a while, so that looked like a great opportunity to go together. Early in 2020 we bought plane tickets for the entire family. Then COVID-19 happened and the offsite was cancelled. Instead, we had a virtual offsite May 18-21 2020.

The offsite was about four hours every day, from Monday to Thursday. I've participated in several sessions. Some of them are a session on Kubernetes, shell scripting and real device testing with Kobiton. I've lead [Test Strategy By RiskStorming With TestSphere](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T252704) session.
