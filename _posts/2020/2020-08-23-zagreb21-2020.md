This race was originally scheduled for March, but it was cancelled because of COVID-19. The original date was also when Zagreb was hit with the biggest earthquake in 140 years, so the race would be canceled without COVID-19. See my blog post [Half marathon March 2020](/half-marathon-march-2020).

The new date was on a weekend that I've planned to run 20-30 km anyway, so I've decided to run the race. Masks were required only at the start. Official time 1:50:41.
