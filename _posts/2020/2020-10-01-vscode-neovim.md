I've started using Vim in [2014](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/commit/a21f4bb5834695dafba64e7c59a05694eaf52fdc). I've read a few books, wrote a few articles and gave a few talks on [Vim](/tags/vim). I really like editing text with Vim, but I was never happy with it's file management, extensions, things like that.

I've noticed that Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is used by slightly more than 50% of developers that participated in [2019 Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools). (I didn't find editors section in [2020 survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#development-environments-and-tools).)

I've learned about Neovim in [Modern Vim](https://pragprog.com/titles/modvim/modern-vim/) book. (I never wrote the book review.) I've started using Neovim in [2018](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/commit/c4320cae324b5c06169be6267bb839becb1960cb) after I've started reading the book.

I've noticed more and more people using VSCode so I gave it a try earlier this year.  The only record I have is a commit in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/commit/87e71cc4e3487a1d88249f4205fbba4785fddd5e) from a few days ago, but I know I've been using it for a few months. I liked VSCode in general. It has all the features I need and a lot of extensions. But, after using Vim, editing text using anything else feels like walking backwards. (Editing text using Vim feels like running. Forwards.)

vscode-neovim VSCode extension was all I needed to connect the two. A real Vim implementation (not an emulator!) inside VSCode.

You need three things. VSCode, Neovim and vscode-neovim.

Installing VSCode is simple, download the installer from the site.

Installing Neovim should also be simple. I've installed it on a Mac using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and all I needed to do was:

```shell
brew install --HEAD neovim
```

`--HEAD` part is important. It will install version 0.5. If you don't use `--HEAD` you will get version 0.4. vscode-neovim needs version 0.5.

vscode-neovim is installed from VSCode Extensions. Search for *Neo Vim* by Alexey Svetliakov.
