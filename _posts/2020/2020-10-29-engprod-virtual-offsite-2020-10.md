title: Engineering Productivity Virtual Offsite October 2020
---
October 26-29 2020 was my team's second virtual offsite. We've had many offsites, but the first virtual one was in May 2020. The structure of this offsite was similar to the one in May. About four hours of sessions every day, from Monday to Thursday.

I've participated in several sessions. For example, [setting up Phabricator locally using Docker](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/post/view/214/spin_up_a_basic_local_phabricator_instance_with_docker/) and [Screenshot Tests, Automated Testing, and Data Driven Testing](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T266622). I've lead a session on writing a blog post. The last day we've played a few games together, including [Trivia Murder Party](https://www.jackboxgames.com/trivia-murder-party/) and [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us).
