This was the last Testival meetup in 2020, and the first ever that was completely online. In 2017 we've organized 7 meetups, in 2018 10, in 2019 12, in 2020 just 4. We've started the year in the usual meetup-every-month style, but that lasted only from January to March. We had a long break since March and decided to organize a online meetup in December, since the COVID situation is unlikely to improve any time soon.

Regular talks:

- Ines Bushara, Mateja Škriljak - [The many flavors of QA](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/testival/blob/master/files/59/The_many_flavours_of_QA.pdf)

Lightning talks:

- Alexander Todorov - Welcome to [FOSDEM'21 Testing and Automation devroom](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/)
- Karlo Smid - Testing from trenches, big trouble in Meetup.com with cropping uploaded event feature image
- Željko Filipin - [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport
