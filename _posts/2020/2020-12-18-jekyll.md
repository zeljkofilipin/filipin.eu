I have started blogging in 2005. I've used many blogging tools since. In 2014 I've [switched](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/filipin.eu/commit/352e8b3b77d28375261011fb16fff52e38b20919) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I'm really surprised that I've never written about Jekyll until now.

## How it works

I like Jekyll because it's simple. Post are just [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. For example, you can see the source for this post at [GitHub](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/filipin.eu/blob/master/_posts/2020/2020-12-18-jekyll.md). Jekyll transforms Markdown files into HTML files. That's all.

## How to deploy it

You can host the HTML files anywhere, if you choose.

There's a simpler way. Host Markdown files at GitHub. There is no need to host HTML files. The code for my blog is at [zeljkofilipin/filipin.eu](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/filipin.eu), if you want to see how I do it. GitHub supports Jekyll via [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). I will not go into detail about that in this post. In short, you push Markdown documents to Github, it renders the HTML files.

## Local development environment

I've recently made some optimizations to my local development environment. It works great for me and I wanted to share it. When I work on a post, I have two windows open. In one window is the HTML of the post opened in a browser. In another window is Markdown in VSCode. See screenshot at the top of the post for an example. As I type the text in VSCode, it is saved every second. Jekyll needs 2-3 seconds to update the HTML. The post automatically updates in the browser.

## Editor

 I have written about my editor setup in [Visual Studio Code + Neovim](/vscode-neovim). I will not go into detail about that part here. Important part is that your editor automatically saves the files. I have set my editor to save every second. If you're using VSCode, add this to `Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json`.

{% highlight json %}
{
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you prefer, you can set it up in the GUI too.

## Jekyll

Start a local web server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`. To automatically refresh the HTML file in the browser, use `--livereload`. By default, Jekyll will rebuild the entire site. That can take a while. 10-20 seconds, depending how big your blog is. To speed things up, use `--incremental`. Jekyll will only rebuild changed files. It should take only 2-3 seconds. I'm sure there are further optimizations, but that is fast enough for me.

In short, use this.

{% highlight console %}
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --incremental
{% endhighlight %}

## Demo

This video shows how it all works. In this example, I delete an image from the top of the article and move it under the first paragraph. The post in the browser automatically refreshes after a few seconds.
