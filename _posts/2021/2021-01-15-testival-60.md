This was the first Testival meetup in 2021. The meetup continues with the online format. We are slowly getting used to it. One advantage of online meetups is that speakers can be from anywhere in the world. So, this time the speaker comes from Portugal. 🇵🇹

Regular talks:

- Sérgio Freire - Leveraging the power of your testing with Xray
