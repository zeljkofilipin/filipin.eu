My team at work has a series of informal meetings on various topics called [Lunch and learn](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Engineering_Productivity_Team/Lunch_and_learn). This week I gave a talk on [Deep Work](/deep-work).

I've really struggled to write a short summary of the book in a blog post. I've failed. The post ended up being pretty long. I've also struggled to create [slides](/assets/pdf/deep-work.pdf) for the talk. I've ended up with 61 slides.

The meeting is usually about 50 minutes long. That is less than a minute per slide. The original plan was to have a 20-30 minute talk and 20-30 minutes for questions and discussion. I've worked really hard on writing the blog post and creating the slides that I ran out of time to rehearse the talk. I've managed to rehearse it only once. The rehearsal took about 60 minutes, so I knew it would be hard to make the talk fit in the usual 50 minutes. At the end, I think my talk was at least 70 minutes. That's without questions or discussion.
