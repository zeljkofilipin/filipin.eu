This is our third online meetup. We're slowly getting used to the format. The first two had about 50 people registered, but usually only half attend the meetup. This time we had almost 100 registrations, and about half of them attended. That makes this meetup the most attended online meetup!

# Regular talks

- Matea Đonlić, Ema Vergles - How I got started with QA - two different experiences in the same team

My talk was about a simple game in Scratch. Almost as a joke, I've pasted my [LinkedIn URL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeljkofilipin/) in the chat and said that I'm glad to receive Scratch endorsements. I didn't expect much out of it, but as this screenshot shows, I've received quite a few endorsements. (The screenshot only shows a few.)
