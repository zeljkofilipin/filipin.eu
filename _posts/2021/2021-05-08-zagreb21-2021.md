I've ran this race [last year](/zagreb21-2020) for the first time. As last year, the race was originally scheduled for March, but it was cancelled because of COVID-19. This year, it was rescheduled for May.

Official time 1:47:23. Strava says it's my "2nd best estimated Half-Marathon effort (1:46:11)". I was hoping to beat my half-marathon record (1:45) for a few minutes, but it didn't happen.

You can see me cross the finish line at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F72hMINBoE&t=6800s) (around 1:53:23).
