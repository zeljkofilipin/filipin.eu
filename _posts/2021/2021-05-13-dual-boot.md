# Environment

The dual boot machine is a 11-inch MacBook Air (early 2014), 1,4 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5.

# Linux

I've installed Linux on many machines. I've even installed it on a few Mac machines. What I never got right is how to [dual boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) Linux and macOS. The missing piece of the puzzle was a tool called [bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader). When installing a Linux on a non-Mac, bootloader is installed by default and it works just fine. The problem is that Macs have a different way of loading the operating system, so a special bootloader is required.

# Ubuntu

To make things as easy as possible for me, I've decided to dual boot Ubuntu. I have some experience with it, and as far as I know, it's the most user friendly Linux.

I was installing Ubuntu on a MacBook Air with (with no DVD drive) so the only option was booting from a USB stick. Official Ubuntu [Create a bootable USB stick on macOS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#1-overview) instructions were good. The only thing that I didn't like was that they recommend installing at tool (Etcher) to create a bootable USB stick. I prefer not to install tools that I will use only once, especially when there's a built in command line tool already in macOS that will do that. See [How to install Ubuntu on MacBook using USB Stick](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20install%20Ubuntu%20on%20MacBook%20using%20USB%20Stick).

# rEFInd

Bootloader that was recommended at several places was [rEFInd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REFInd). The trick is that recent Macs have SIP (System Integrity Protection). To install rEFInd, you have to disable SIP.

Boot into recovery mode (restart and hold command+R), open Terminal and execute this to disable SIP.

csrutil disable
{% endhighlight %}

Reboot. [Download rEFInd](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/files/). Install it.

{% highlight text %}
./refind-install
{% endhighlight %}

Boot into recovery mode again and enable SIP.

{% highlight text %}
csrutil enable
{% endhighlight %}
