Today is the last day of [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2021). [Vidhi Mody](https://www.vidhimody.me/) and [Soham Parekh](https://www.sohamp.dev/) were mentoring [Sahil Grewal](https://sahilgrewalhere2001.medium.com/) on updating [WebdriverIO to version 7](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T274579) in Wikimedia repositories.

For me, this was the easiest internship that I was involved so far. Mostly because I was not an official mentor this time. I was just helping Vidhi and Soham.

To gather ideas for this post, I was reading my other posts about mentoring. Looks like even back in [2013](/outreach-program-for-women) I've learned the lesson that there should be two mentors per intern. We've had situations where a mentor can't work for weeks because of health reasons. Also, the internship is over the summer and (at least in Europe) it's common for people to take a few weeks of vacation. So, two mentors is highly recommended.

This time I got the fun part of the internship. I didn't need to do any paperwork, like preparing for the internship and evaluating the student. I was mostly reviewing code and pair programming. I like both of those activities, so the internship was a lot of fun for me.

My plan was to take a break from mentoring for a while, but I have a good idea for an internship project and the next round of [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internship is soon...
