A few years ago we had regular reading club meetings at work. I really liked it. We would pick an article or a book and read it. Every month we would have a meeting and discuss the article or the book. If it was a long book, we would split it in several months. We didn't have a reading club for a while. I've missed it.

I've started working from an office recently and I've found several interesting books there. I've read most of them, but a long time ago. I wanted to read them again. Reading with other people is always more fun, so I've decided to start the reading club again.

I've thought hard about the order in which to read the books. People on my team are on several continents, so I've tried finding the books that are available in ebook format. That should make it easier for everybody to get the book. I've also checked book ratings on Goodreads and Amazon. This [task](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T247665) lists the books in the order in which we plan to read them. Book prices and ratings are also included.

I thought a shorter read would be a good warm up for the reading club. I've heard about schools of software testing many years ago. I liked the idea immediately. I find it a good tool to explain why the experts are talking about different things when they talk about testing.

After a bit of searching, I've found several presentations, blog posts and videos about the topic. If you know about more good sources of information about the topic, please do let me know. This is the list.

School names change from author to author and with the time. As far as I can see, these are the five schools and their names.

- Analytic / Analytical
- Standard / Factory
- Quality / Quality Assurance / Control
- Context-Driven
- Agile / Test-driven

We've had two meetings. TODO: write about meetings
