I have been working remotely since 2005. That's 16 years. I think it's safe to assume that I have some experience with it. Some of the advice I'll give in this post might apply to you, some of it might not. Most of the advice should be useful regardless of how you work, from the office, from a co-working space or from home. You don't have to take all of the advice. Especially not all at once. I didn't.

# Computer

You'll probably need one. I've used many desktops and laptops. Most computers today should work just fine. I prefer one big screen or two smaller ones. I have 27 inch iMac from 2012, and it still works great. (I did upgrade RAM and SSD a few years ago.)

When traveling, I prefer a very small laptop. I've tried a few options over the years, even very small (and cheap) chromebooks. I've settled on 11 inch MacBook Air from 2014. It still works just fine.

# Internet

I never had to pay much for internet (even in 2005) and it worked well most of the time. I had some trouble with routers, but not much. Today, probably the cheapest wired internet you can buy should work just fine. If you work from a building with many apartments, wifi might now work all the time, for various reasons. It took me some effort to set it up because my desk was not so close to the router, but buying a very long [ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) cable and plugging it in router and my desktop machine improved my internet speed, latency and stability significantly. I would recommend [fast.com](https://fast.com/) (by Netflix) for testing your connection.

Sometimes I work while traveling, and setting up my phone as a router works great.

# Desk

"I'll work from my couch." Don't. You'll need your body long after you've retired. Don't break it while you're young. Any office desk should work just fine. Bonus points for desks with adjustable height, so you can alternate between sitting and standing. I know IKEA has a few of those.

# Chair

"I'll work from the kitchen." Don't. It's probably better than the couch, but you'll be sitting many hours, for many years. Kitchen chairs are not made for that. Invest in a good chair. I have [SpinaliS HACKER](https://www.spinalis.com/office-chairs/spinalis-hacker/) for a decade or so. I don't know how available they are globally.

# Keyboard

I've used many keyboards. I really liked Apple's bluetooth keyboard, but after a few years of using it, it caused some hand pain. A few years ago, I've switched to [Kinesis Advantage2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) and never had any problems since. It did take me a while to get used to it. It was worth the effort.

# Mouse

I've tried many mice. I really like Apple's bluetooth mouse. Any mouse I've used with my right hand caused my some hand pain. I've tried switching to left hand (I'm right-handed) and never had any trouble since. I does take some time to learn how to use the mouse with the left hand, but it's definitely worth the effort.

# Headphones

You'll need headphones. If you're sharing an office you'll probably want to block disturbing noises. Listening to music or white noise is a good way to do that. Headphones are also very important for video meetings. Looks like we'll have more of those in the next few years. I've tried many, in-ear, over-the-ear, cheap and expensive, bluetooth and wired. I mostly use the cheap Apple wired in-ear headphones.

# Text Chat

You'll need to communicate with people. I've used many chat software. I don't have strong opinions. For many years, I've used IRC via [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com). Lately I mostly use Slack. From communication perspective, it's almost not important which tool you use. It's important that you can communicate both socially (non-work related topics) and professionally (work related topics) with the people you work with. For various reasons (like avoiding [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) you might want to avoid some tools. Like Slack.

# Audio/Video Chat

I've separated this from text chat, because it's different. Most of the time, e-mail, text chat and similar will work just fine. Sometimes, the best way to resolve problems is to talk face-to-face, or share a screen. As usual, I've used many video chat software. Most of them work just fine.

# Water-cooler Meeting

TODO.

# Time Tracking

I think I've started tracking time as soon as I've started working remotely. Remove work gives you great flexibility, most of the time. You can start or stop working when ever you want. You can split the day with a long lunch break. It's very easy to spend the day doing private stuff instead of working. To paraphrase the [Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility): "with great flexibility comes great responsibility". I track my time in 5-minute intervals. I don't track things that take less than 5 minutes. I don't think that any employer ever asked me to track my time. I still do it.

# Flexibility

I would encourage you to take advantage of the flexibility that remote work offers. You can do shopping, exercise if your favorite gym, go to movies (...) when most of the people are working. Just make sure you track the time you've worked.

# Work Hours

There isn't an universal best time to work. It will mostly depend on your current situation. Most of the people I work with live in the US. I live in Europe. For some of my colleagues, there is nine hour time difference. Some people choose to work at the time when most of the company works, however unusual that work hours are in their country. I have a family, so that doesn't work for me. I still have plenty of late meetings, sometimes until 7pm.

# Travel

Before COVID, I used to travel for work a few times a year. Just enough for my taste to see the world, but not to much. I like to travel. I've visited many countries and cities. Unfortunately, sometimes you're in a great place, but the only thing you see is a hotel and a conference venue. Fortunately, trips like that were very rare. I usually managed to spend at least half day sight seeing. Sometimes even a few days.

# Exercise

I've originally named this chapter *Serious Exercise*. You will be sitting for many many hours. For many many years. Your body is not made for that.

I would highly recommend [The Healthy Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer/) book. It is marketed towards programmers, but it's important for any office job.
