# Mentoring

Every time I finish a [mentorship](tags/mentor), I read my blog posts about previous mentorships. Almost every time I finish a mentorship I write that I'll probably take a break from mentoring for a while, but then I don't. ðŸ˜…

# Introduction

For the last few months I have been mentoring [Osama Ahmed Tahir](https://medium.com/@osamaahmedtahir17). He was an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) [Round 23](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Outreachy/Round_23) intern. He was working on [refactoring WebdriverIO tests](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T256626) from sync to async mode. That was a very challenging task. Both of us didn't know much about async/await when the internship started.

As I was preparing for this blog post, I checked when was the first time I've met Osama. Looks like the first interaction we had was on Zulip in October 2021. He introduced himself and asked a question. We've had many conversations since and got to know each other pretty well.

# Tasks

He created [23 tasks](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/query/mEKeSiZyuPe3/#R) in Phabricator (our task tracking tool) and resolved [13](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/query/yG7L5nEAxIE6/#R) of them. Besides his main task, he also worked on several small side projects. An interesting one was [deleting invisible Unicode characters](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T300386). He also worked on updating [documentation](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T256239) for our local development environment.

# Commits

Osama created [45 commits](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/owner:osamaahmedtahir17%2540gmail.com) in Gerrit, our code review tool. [16](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/owner:osamaahmedtahir17%2540gmail.com+is:merged) of those commits are merged so far. A notable commit is [730546](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/core/+/730546) for the MediaWiki Core repository that needed 69 updates before it was merged. We needed [3 more follow up commits](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/owner:osamaahmedtahir17%2540gmail.com+project:mediawiki/core+is:merged) to finish the task in that repository. ðŸ˜¬

Besides his main project, notable commits include releasing a [new version](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/core/+/744818) of an npm package and [fixing a dependency](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/wikimedia/portals/deploy/+/766163) in one of our projects.

# Communication

Osama has documented the internship both on [his personal blog](https://medium.com/@osamaahmedtahir17) and on [my team blog](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/phame/blog/view/21/). We have used [Zulip](https://wikimedia.zulipchat.com/) for chat and [Google Meet](https://apps.google.com/meet/) for video meetings.

# Conclusion

I really like mentoring. I learn something new with each intern I mentor. I hope they also learn something from me.
