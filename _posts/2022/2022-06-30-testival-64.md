# Introduction

It was a very long time since the last in-person Testival meetup. Just before the COVID pandemic, we had meetup [#58](testival-58), in March 2020. Before that, we've been meeting regularly every month for years. We also had a conference every year. It feels really strange that there was no in-person meetup or a conference in over two years.

There were a few online-only meetups in 2020 and 2021. Even online meetups have stopped since [Karlo](https://blog.tentamen.eu/testival-community-ending-scene/) and [I have stepped down](https://filipin.eu/stepping-down-as-testival-organizer) as organizers.

[Niko Mađar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niko-madar/) has decided to organize the [Testival conference](https://testival.eu/) this year. In addition to that, he decided to organize the Testival meetup. I wish him all the luck.

# Testival Meetup #64

Finally, this month we had [Testival Meetup #64](https://www.meetup.com/testival/events/286034317/). About 30 people came. A nice number considering the meetup was on a break for a couple of years.

The meetup used the usual format that I really like. Nike gave a short introduction. Then everybody shortly introduced themselves. I think this is such a critical part of the meetup. It's really important to get to know the people. It's really rare that somebody doesn't want to introduce themselves. During the introduction [Iva Čičin-Šain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivacicinsain/) said she was the one that came up with the name Testival. (I couldn't remember that when I wrote [Stepping down as Testival Organizer](https://filipin.eu/stepping-down-as-testival-organizer).)

# Talks

There were two talks. I have a few notes.

- Vesna Bilić - Excel in your QA career!
- Niko Mađar - How programs test programs

From Vesna's talk:

- You can manage your career proactive or reactive.
- To advance your career you have to step out of your comfort zone.
- Life is long. There is time.
- Besides technical knowledge, life experience is required.
- Book recommendation - [Team Topologies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420): Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.

From Niko's talk:

- [Photomath Engineering](https://medium.com/photomath-engineering) blog.

There was interesting discussion during and after each talk.

The only complaint I have is that it was hard to hear the speakers. For the first talk I was sitting at the back and I was struggling to hear. I've moved to the first row during the break between the talks, so I could hear better. A sound system is required for such a big room.

Niko announced lightning talks at the beginning, but forgot about them at the end. I think it's perfectly normal to forget something the first time you're organizing a meetup.

# After the Talks

After the talks the majority of the people stayed to chat. The reason I don't like online meetups is that this social component is missing. Online, you can't easily form small groups that split and merge chaotically.

# Conclusion

It was great to see, after a very long time, Testival organizers and regular attendees. Niko said the plan is to continue with meetups every month. I'm looking forward to more meetups.
