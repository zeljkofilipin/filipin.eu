# Introduction

In 2021, the Product department of Wikimedia Foundation had an *Inspiration Week* ([internal link](https://office.wikimedia.org/wiki/Product/Inspiration_Week)). Since I'm in the Technology department, I didn't participate. I did hear about it and thought it sounded interesting.

I guess the first *Inspiration Week* went well since in 2022 the Technology department decided to join the fun ([internal link](https://office.wikimedia.org/wiki/Engineering/Inspiration_Week_2022)). So this year, I got to participate.

As far as I understand it, *Inspiration Week* is half-vacation. You can participate, or not. You can participate in it anything between full-time and not-at-all. You can work on a work related project or a personal project. You can read a book or exercise. As long as you get *inspiration* from it, I guess.

I was initially a bit confused on how it would actually work, but I decided to participate full-time. I've canceled all of my meetings that week, decided not to work on any of my usual projects and got serious about *inspiration*. I had so many projects I wanted to work on, my biggest problem was picking a project that I could finish in a week.

So, what did I do during the week?

# Getting Things Done

Every time I'm overwhelmed, I spend some time reviewing my projects. From my experience, spending some time planning pays off multiple times.

First, I've started with a very good review of my projects. I'm a big fan of [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and I try to keep a list of my projects and contexts up to date. Since it takes a few hours to review them all, I usually just do a quick review of current projects and contexts. Since I was looking for *inspiration*, I've decided to review all projects in the someday/maybe list. It's a long list. After getting my mind clear about all the things I wanted to do and what is possible to do in a week, I've made a decision.

I've decided to focus on one bigger project that required a lot of time, but also spend some time on a few smaller projects that didn't require a lot of time. Whenever I needed a break, I would pick up one of the smaller projects.

# SikuliX

I've decided to make getting to know [SikuliX](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T243397) the main project of the week. It's a tool I've used a few times in the last couple of decades, but it's been a while since I've used it last. I've played with it over the week, but unfortunately the project didn't end up with something I could show at the end.

# Backup

Backing up is something I know is important. I think I have it set up so I don't lose anything important. I also try to download data from online services to a local machine every month or two. I was reminded how this is important after an intern I was mentoring got locked out of his GitHub account, losing access to a few very important repositories that he didn't have locally. Of course, online services don't make it fast or easy to download data, so I end up doing it a few times a year. Since I had some time, I've decided to spend an hour or two backing up everything.

# Duolingo

I learned German in high school, but I've never used it since. In 2020 I've decided to pick it up again using [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com). I've been pretty consistent with practicing it.

Every week you join a group of 50 people, a league. Points are earned by practicing a language. At the end of the week, the first few advance to a higher league, the last few drop to a lower league. Over time, I've reached the hardest, tenth league, Diamond.

Duolingo also has achievements. Legendary achievement is awarded if you finish #1 in the Diamond League. Well, I've never even been close. I just don't spend enough time using Duolingo. Until *Inspiration Week*. I've decided to spend some time every day on Duolingo, just enough to stay #1. Long story short, somehow I managed to finish first and got the achievement!

# Juggling

I learned how to juggle at a conference a few years ago. The very simple three-ball juggle. I've had a lot of fun juggling. But, over time, I stopped. I was recently cleaning up my garage and noticed my juggling balls. I took them to the office and decided to practice a few minutes every day. I got to the point that I can now again juggle for a while without dropping the balls all the time.

# Chess

I've started playing chess in 2021, mostly on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com). I usually don't have a lot of time for it, so during *Inspiration Week* I've done a few lessons, solved a few daily puzzles and reviewed a few recent games I've played.

# Yousician

I've played the guitar since high school and drums since college. In 2018 I've started using [Yousician](https://yousician.com) to practice guitar, ukulele and bass. I've finished ukulele and bass courses and I'm finishing the guitar course. I'm currently trying to finish a very hard song on level 10, [Practice Heart](https://yousician.com/songs/guitar/practice-heart/568dcb7ae8dec34ab05e6808) by Mr Fastfinger. Level 10 is the last level. I usually only play about 10 minutes every day after lunch. During *Inspiration Week* I've played a bit more. I've made nice progress, but I didn't manage to finish the song. I've *almost* finished it.

# Geocaching

I got introduced to [geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com) in 2019 at a conference. Since then I've managed to find more than 100 geocaches and I've hidden about 10. During *Inspiration Week* I've decided to take a longer bike ride to work one day and do some geocaching. During the bike ride I've replaced one of my caches that went missing, found a cache that I've looked for before but couldn't find it then, looked for a couple of caches but I didn't managed to find them, checked if a couple of caches are in place (one of them I own and one I just managed to be nearby). Finally, I've gathered data for a few multi caches.

# Book

I try to read a book for about 30 minutes every morning before starting work. It's usually a book on software testing that my team reads for our book club. During *Inspiration Week* I spend some time in the morning reading a book that's not about work.

# Audible and Goodreads

I always liked to read. In 2015 I discovered [Audible](https://www.audible.com) and audiobooks. In 2016 I discovered [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). I have so many audiobooks that I've canceled my Audible membership until I listen to them all. It will take me a year or two. With so many books, it's a struggle to figure out what to listen to next. So, I've decided to spend some time making a listening plan for the next year or two.

# Strava

I ran my first half-marathon in 2002. I discovered [Strava](https://www.strava.com) in 2016. I ran several half-marathons and one marathon. I'm currently training for a half-marathon. During *Inspiration Week* I went for a few runs early in the morning before work.

# Conclusion

I have really enjoyed *Inspiration Week*. I've managed to make some progress on a project I had in mind for a very long time but never had the time for it. I've also managed to either finish or make progress on several smaller ongoing projects. I hope we have another *Inspiration Week* next year.
