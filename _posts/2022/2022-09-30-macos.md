title: Setting up a new macOS machine
---
I've recently had to set up a new macOS machine. I don't trust syncing, so I do it manually. I've heard that macOS syncing works great these days from a few people, but I still prefer to set up a new machine manually. It might be just bad experiences from the past.

I have two reasons for the manual setup. First, it forces me to keep notes on software I install and configurations I make to the operating system and applications. Secondly, over the years the machine will accumulate a lot of unused software and settings. I like to start fresh every year or two. My notes have the essentials. If I set up a new machine and notice that an application or setting is missing, I update the notes.

I've mentioned to a coworker that I have notes on macOS setup and she asked if I could make it public.

# App Store

The first thing I install and the only app I download from the App Store is [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/), a window manager. I know there are others, but I've been using this one for more than a decade and it works just fine.

# Homebrew

The next thing I install is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), a package manager for macOS. I use it to install pretty much everything else.

# Firefox

Then I install my favorite browser, [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

    brew install firefox

Next, a few Firefox addons:

- [DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/)
- [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)
- [LastPass Password Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/)
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [Croatian](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/croatian-dictionary/) and [English](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/us-english-dictionary/) dictionaries

# Applications

Then I install other apps I use regularly.

    brew install ack android-file-transfer deezer git-review google-chrome mr neovim node@14 p7zip ruby sync visual-studio-code vlc yousician zoom homebrew/cask/docker

# Terminal

I make a few minor tweaks to the Terminal.

- General > On startup, open > New window with profile: Homebrew
- Profiles > Homebrew > Text > Font > Andale Mono 14

# TextEdit

I don't use TextEdit much, but when I use it, I only need plain text editing.

- New Document > Format > Plain text
- New Document > Font > Plain text font > Menlo Regular 14

# macOS

I update macOS and check Finder preferences and System Preferences. I usually need to make a few tweaks.

# Browsers

I prefer that browsers download to Desktop instead of Downloads folder, so I'll make the change in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

# SSH

I mostly follow GitHub's [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) page.

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "computer-name"
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ssh-add -l

I add Gerrit's [fingerprint](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:SSH_Fingerprints/gerrit.wikimedia.org:29418) to the known_hosts file.

    ssh -oFingerPrintHash=md5 -p 29418 zfilipin@gerrit.wikimedia.org

Finally, I upload my public key to [Gerrit](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/settings/#SSHKeys) and [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys).

# Dotfiles

I don't have such a huge investment in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/) repository as some people I know, but I still find that repository very valuable. It makes copying configuration from one machine to another trivial.

    mkdir -p ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/
    git clone git@github.com:zeljkofilipin/dotfiles.git ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles

    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.ssh/config.macos ~/.ssh/config
    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~
    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.gitignore_global ~
    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.mrconfig.macos ~/.mrconfig
    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.zprofile ~
    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/.zshrc ~

# mr

I use [mr](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mr) to automatically update more than 90 repositories every day. On a clean machine, the tool will clone all repositories.

    mr u

# MediaWiki-Docker

I use [MediaWiki-Docker](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Docker) for the local MediaWiki development environment.

# Fresh

I use [Fresh](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/fresh) to run MediaWiki tests on my machine. When the tool is installed, download the container.

    fresh-node -env -net

# Visual Studio Code

Did I mention I don't trust much in syncing? So, I Copy Visual Studio Code configuration file from dotfiles.

    cp ~/Documents/github/zeljkofilipin/dotfiles/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json

I really like a few extensions:
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

# Neovim

I prefer editing text in Vim. These days I usually use [Neovim in Visual Studio Code](https://filipin.eu/vscode-neovim). To use Neovim in Visual Studio Code install the [VSCode Neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim) extension.

On macOS, h, j, k and l movement keys may not repeat in visual mode when held. This is the fix.

    defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

I would like to thank [Kosta Harlan](https://www.kostaharlan.net/) for reviewing the article and for advice on how to make it better.
