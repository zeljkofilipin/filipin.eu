Finally, after a few years, I've been to a conference. The last conference I went to was [WebCamp Zagreb 2019](/webcamp-zagreb-2019). This was the first Testival conference that I have attended as a participant, not an organizer.

Unfortunately, I have been really busy in the last couple of months. I didn't have the time to write something about the conference until now. I took some photos and notes during the conference, so I think I have enough material for a blog post.

The organizing team did a great job. There were more than 130 people at the conference. When I was one of the organizers, we never had more than about 70. üòÖ

I really like the Testival conference [open space](http://citconf.com/openspace.php) format that the conference used for years. In addition to open space, Testival had two keynotes and lightning talks. I gave two lightning talks, one about a [book club](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T247665) I organized for my team at work and another one about [chess](/tags/chess). Since the lunch break was long, I organized a chess workshop during the break.

I have participated in several sessions including career development, the future of testing and self education.

After the conference I had dinner with [Davor Banoviƒá](https://www.davorbanovic.com/) (a published book author) and [Karlo ≈†mid](https://karlosmid.com/) (a performing stand-up comedian). Davor has organized the first testing conference in Croatia, [viaqa](/viaqa-2010) (in 2010). Karlo has organized the first testing meetup in Croatia, [Software Testers Speak Up Meeting](/zagreb-stc-1) (in 2011). The three of us were the Testival core organizing team for about a decade, organizing monthly meetups and yearly conferences.

I woke up early before the conference, so I had the time for an easy and long run on the beautiful Drava river bank.
