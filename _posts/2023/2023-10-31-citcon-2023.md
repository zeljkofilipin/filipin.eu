*This is how conferences should be organized. The famous living and evolving board with sessions. Everybody can vote and move sessions around the board.*

# Introduction

This was the sixth time I have participated. After participating at CITCON 2012, we have decided to change the format of our local Testival conference from the usual format to the crazy open-space/unconference model. I have even organized one of them (Zagreb 2014).

I have attended many [conferences](tags/event). Looking at the list of conferences, I can see that I've attended a lot of them just once, and some of them many times. CITCON is one of the rare conferences I return to.

In 2016 I even wrote a blog post [Don't Go to Conferences](dont-go-to-conferences). To [quote myself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark):

> I have been to a lot of conferences. I have been a speaker at some of them. I have even helped organize a few. I like going to conferences. I also think that going to most of the conferences is a waste of time.

Going to CITCON is *not* a waste of time.

# Before the Conference

When I seriously started thinking about going to the conference, I contacted Christoph Jauera from [Wikimedia Deutschland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland) (WMDE). WMDE has an office in Berlin. He decided to join me for the conference. He also organized a small informal hackathon on Friday before the conference in their office. One more person joined. We talked about a project we are working on, upgrading WebdriverIO to v8 ([T324685](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T324685)). It was great to meet people in person. Some for the first time, some after a few years pause caused by the recent pandemic.

# At the Conference

I love the CITCON conference. It's a day and a half event.

Day one is shorter, half day. It's always on Friday afternoon with a short introduction on how the conference works. Then, everybody sits in a big circle and shortly introduces themselves. After that, everybody can propose a session, or multiple sessions. That's followed by dinner during which everybody can vote on sessions and move them around the schedule. It sounds like chaos, but it works great. Friday itself is a lot of fun and the conference didn't even start for real.

There were a lot of people at the conference interested in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI). I proposed four sessions. Three of them gathered enough votes to be scheduled.

Saturday, day two, is a longer, full day. It's when the sessions happen.

I have started the day with Testing a full Linux distribution completely automated session. There were just the three of us in the session, but it was great. That's how it often is at CITCON. Sometimes the smallest sessions are the most interesting.

The next session I joined was How to learn from frustration. (In case it was not obvious so far, not all sessions were about software development.) That was a great session. I'll post a couple of my notes.

- *Being wrong* feels perfectly normal.
- *Learning you are wrong* feels bad.

During the session, I learned about the [Four Tendencies Framework](https://gretchenrubin.com/four-tendencies/) (Upholder, Questioner, Rebel, Obliger).

On Friday I proposed a chess session during lunch on Saturday. When lunch time came, I set up a couple of chess boards. There was no big plan, just to play some chess. We have spontaneously self-organized into two groups. It was a mix of lessons and playing.

After lunch, my session Healthy coder was merged with Live outside work. We have talked about staying healthy while our jobs require us to sit for many hours, for many years and decades. A few books were recommended.

- [The Healthy Programmer](https://healthyprog.com)
- [Better Than Before](https://gretchenrubin.com/books/better-than-before)
- [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)
- [Die With Zero](https://www.diewithzerobook.com)

Then, it was time for another session I have proposed, [Deep Work](https://filipin.eu/tags/deep-work). I am a big fan of the book. I will use every excuse to talk about it.

The final session was Using ChatGPT to write anything. I have not used it before. It was a good introduction. We were collaboratively rewriting the conference homepage with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt). A couple of other tools to help with writing were mentioned.

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/)

The conference closes with another session of everybody sitting in a big circle. (There's an obvious lack of a fire in the middle of the circle.) Everybody shares one or more [aha moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect) from the conference. I was very glad to hear that a few people liked the Deep Work session.

# After the Conference

I had a lot of fun playing chess during lunch at the conference, so I have created a chess club for the attendees of the conference, so we can stay in touch and play. If you were at the conference and want to join the club, let me know on the conference slack.

# Branding

I was thinking a lot about the conference while writing this blog post, so I have posted this in the conference slack channel. After some thought, I think it would be good to make it public.

> We had a short discussion about renaming/rebranding CITCON at dinner after the conference. I'm not sure if the organizers would seriously consider that.
>
> First, I think CITCON is an established brand and I do not propose changing the name. That said, I thought CITCON stands for continuous integration and testing conference but after reading the website I don't see that anywhere. So, maybe the rebranding has already started.
>
> Archive.org confirms my theory that at least 2006-2016 it was branded a continuous integration and testing conference. In 2017 the homepage starts talking about continuous improvement.
>
> In my opinion, that is the direction the conference should move to and market itself. From my experience, CITCON is more of a general software development conference, with emphasis on continuous improvement, with a lot of people interested in testing and CI/CD. Testing and CI/CD were maybe more important in the first decade of the conference (but I have missed it) than they are now.
>
> I'm not sure if organizers can share the numbers of registrations/attendees/sponsors over the years. Are the numbers stable/growing/declining? Do you have a short/medium/long term plan for the conference? Are you happy with the current numbers? Would you like them to grow?
>
> To move from theory to practice. I'm not sure when the time will be right, but in the next year or two I would like to bring CITCON back to my city. If we market it as a CI+testing conference, we are seriously limiting the amount of both attendees and sponsors. If we market it as a software development conference with focus on continuous improvement, there's a chance of gathering enough people and sponsors.

This is how conferences should be organized. People sitting in a circle, looking each other in the eyes, introducing themselves.
