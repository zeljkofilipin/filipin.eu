## Introduction

In [2010](viaqa-2010) we started with yearly conferences. In [2011](zagreb-stc-1) we started with monthly meetups. It all stopped in 2020 because of COVID. In 2022 I [stepped down](stepping-down-as-testival-organizer) as Testival organizer. Since 2022, there were just a few meetups and one conference.

I decided to try reviving the monthly meetups for a year. So far, there are three people in the core team. We'll try to organize a meetup every month. If all goes well, we'll try to organize a conference next year.

## Testival Meetup #67

We didn't manage to organize a proper meetup with a venue and talks in October. We didn't want to skip this month (we already skipped September) so we decided to at least meet for drinks. Seven people showed up. Some people at the meetup were in the Testival community from 2010, some have joined us along the way, some are new. Everybody introduced themselves and we spent a couple of hours chatting.

We will announce the November meetup soon. Probably even today.
