## Introduction

After a warm-up [meetup in October](testival-67), we had the first real meetup of the 2024/2025 season.

We're looking for companies that will host future Testival meetups. We're also looking for speakers. If you're interested, contact us at <testivaleu@gmail.com>.

## Testival Meetup #68

About 35 people came to the meetup. We started with the usual introductions. I think it is really important that everybody introduces themselves. Networking is more important than talks.

There was one talk about software testing at Njuškalo (the host company). Katarina Raguž gave a talk (in Croatian) *Šuška se šuška kako QA njuška*. (It's a word play. I'm not sure how to translate it.) It was a very interesting talk about their testing practices. Very well delivered too. After the talk, we had a lively discussion. I'm not sure how long the discussion would last if the pizzas didn't arrive.

A lot of people stayed after the talk to socialize over pizza and drinks. I stayed much longer than I planned. A few people approached me because either their company is interested in hosting a future Testival meetup, or they were interested in giving a talk.
