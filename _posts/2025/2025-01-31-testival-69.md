## Meetup

We have skipped the meeting in December. Everybody was too busy having a good time.

This was one of the biggest meetups we ever had. Maybe even the biggest. About fifty people. After the usual introductions, an engineer from the host company gave a talk.

* Viktor Kvaternjak: [How Quality Assurance helps build Secure Software](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/testival/blob/master/files/69/Testival%20Meetup%2069.pdf)?

He talked about a few recent famous attacks on frequently used software and how to protect ourselves, both as software developers and users. I have learned about the service they offer, [Spectra Assure Community](https://secure.software/) (with a cool domain). The service scans all packages in popular public open source repositories (npm, PyPI, RubyGems and NuGet).

After the break we had four lightning talks.

* Marko Bjelac: [SoCraTes UK](https://socratesuk.org/). He talked about an interesting unconference and its format.
* Niko Mađar: [Dependency](https://xkcd.com/2347/). Continuing on the main talk of the meetup, he talked about an attack on a piece of popular open source software.
* Željko Filipin: [Refactoring WebdriverIO Tests From Sync to Async Mode](https://filipin.eu/async). I talked about a multi-year project we have finished recently.
* Karlo Šmid: [CrimeBeats](https://crimebeats.app/). He presented an app that he developed. Police reports shown on Google Maps. Very interesting if you want to see how safe your neighborhood is.

Both regular talk and lightning talks sparked a lot of conversations.

## Future

We already have one speaker for February, but we don't have a host. We have both the host and speakers for [March](https://www.meetup.com/testival/events/304779331/).

We're looking for companies that will host future Testival meetups. We're also looking for speakers. If you're interested in hosting or speaking, contact [Testival](mailto:testivaleu@gmail.com).
