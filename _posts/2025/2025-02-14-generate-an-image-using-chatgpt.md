title: Generate an image using ChatGPT
---

I wanted to illustrate my post about [managers](managers) with an image. To make it more fun, I wanted the person to work under water. A quick search found a few images online, but none of them worked for me. As an experiment, I wanted to use ChatGPT. I asked it for an image of a manager working under water.

It was a good start. I didn't want to insist on the computer being waterproofed, but I thought it would be nice that at least the manager has a chance of surviving. So I asked it to make an image where the manager has scuba gear.

Not bad, but the tube from the facemask doesn't connect to the tank. To my surprise, ChatGPT could not understand how important that is. Here's the gallery of funny attempts. On my part, I was trying to explain that the mask and the tank should be connected with the tube. ChatGPT was generating image after image. It got it almost right here and there, but sometimes the tube passed the manager's body. (I thought that decreased the chances of the manager surviving the day.)

Long story short, we're still working on it. I might just be bad at explaining what I want. If you can generate an image of a manager working under water, where the facemask and the tank are connected, please let me know.

## Conclusion

I recently had a chat about ChatGPT with one of my colleagues. To paraphrase him: "Why are you surprised it failed? It's like asking for navigation directions from a dictionary."
