## Meetup

About twenty people came to the meetup.

There was one regular talk:

* [Marko Bjelac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markobjelac): [Behaviour-driven development without (more) tools](https://github.com/zeljkofilipin/testival/tree/master/files/70)

Marko talked about software development practices in his company. The practices include [behavior-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD) and [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming#Mob_programming).

After a break there were several lightning talks:

* Marko Bjelac: [SoCraTes 2025](https://www.socrates-conference.de/home). He is trying to start a local software crafting meetup and conference.
* Karlo Šmid: [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models). An interesting demonstration of how to run a  [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLM) on your machine.
* Željko Filipin: [BBST Open Course Materials](bbst-open-course-materials). I talked about a course on [black-box testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) that I took with my team.
