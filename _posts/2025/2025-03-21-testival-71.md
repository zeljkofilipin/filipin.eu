## Meetup

About sixty to seventy people came to the meetup. This is probably the biggest meetup we ever had.

There were two regular talks:

* Luka Vladika, End-to-End Testing Redefined: The Testa Platform
* Dinko Vranjicic, Load testing 101

Luka talked about Testa, their internal testing tool. I was hoping it would be an open source tool, or at least commercial, so I could take a closer look. It looked really interesting. As far as I understood it, it's a low-code tool that they use for web and mobile test automation. Everything is in the cloud. The only thing needed on your machine is a web browser.

Dinko gave an overview of load testing. He also talked about a tool they use for load testing [k6](https://k6.io/). From what I saw, it's something I would consider using if I needed to do load testing.

Both talks were in English since some people didn't understand Croatian. Both talks were good and there was a lot of discussion after each talk.

A few of us had ideas for lightning talks, but we were so busy chatting that there was no time.

## Future

We have a host for [April](https://www.meetup.com/testival/events/306455769/) 2025\.

We're looking for companies that will host future Testival meetups. We're also looking for speakers. If you're interested in hosting or speaking, contact [Testival](mailto:testivaleu@gmail.com).
