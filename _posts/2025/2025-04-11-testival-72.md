## Meetup

This time, about thirty people showed up. I say that every time, but I really like that everybody introduces themselves at the beginning.

There was one regular talk:

* Irja Straus: Beyond Pass and Fail

Irja shared her life story since she started as a junior tester and as she progressed through several roles in her career. She mentioned [DORA’s metrics](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/) that I didn't know about.

There were four lightning talks.

* I talked about Magical Minimalism. It's a silly picture book I'm working on, about a world where everybody uses magic all the time. It's similar to our world where everybody uses technology (especially phones) all the time. I wanted to present Digital Minimalism by [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/writing/) in a funny way.
* Karlo Šmid talked about [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_\(programming_language\)).
* I didn't get the speaker's name, but he talked about a failed Macedonian startup TrySpicy.
* Irja Straus talked about how to get a promotion. She mentioned [brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/). I wasn't aware of that until recently when my manager mentioned it.

## Future

We're looking for companies that will host future Testival meetups. We're also looking for speakers. If you're interested in hosting or speaking, contact [Testival](mailto:testivaleu@gmail.com).
