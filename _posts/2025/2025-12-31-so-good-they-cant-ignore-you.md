## Introduction

Cal Newport is one of my favorite authors. I have read almost all of his books. Some of them several times. I also really like his podcast [Deep Questions](https://www.thedeeplife.com/listen/).

I have read this book at least two times. I have read it in late 2022 as an audio book and in early 2025 as an ebook.

2025 was really busy. I wanted to write a review of the book earlier. I usually have the time to write one blog post every month. So, this book never made it to the short list. Until now.

## The Book

The book has four sections. Each section has several chapters. Each section discusses one rule.

* Rule \#1: Don’t Follow Your Passion
* Rule \#2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You (Or, the Importance of Skill)
* Rule \#3: Turn Down a Promotion (Or, the Importance of Control)
* Rule \#4: Think Small, Act Big (Or, the Importance of Mission)

*Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands.… Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration.
